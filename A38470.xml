            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>YOU are here preſented with an Amendment and Supplement, of what was very neceſſary and yet want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Book formerly: ſo that now you will find it to be wholly compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for your purpoſe, in every reſpect; it being altogether grounded upon many years Experience, and Obſervation in the Practice of deliveries; moſt others being written by thoſe that never pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiz'd the Art; and ſome father'd upon Perſons that were no more concerned in them, then the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſuch as Sir <hi>Theodore</hi> de <hi>Mayern,</hi> Dr. <hi>Chamberlen,</hi> and others; by the Publiſhers of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Midwives Practice;</hi> ſo that I may juſtly ſay of this Book; as the Learned Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi> ſays of his Chronicle, that if all other were not to be found
<pb facs="tcp:34775:4"/> this alone were ſufficient, with your dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; For I'll aſſure you, I have not conceal'd one ſecret, belonging to your Art from you; neither would I have you with-hold your knowledge from others; neither have I impoſed upon you any thing that hath not endur'd the Teſt of confirm'd experience; and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I would not have you, upon any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count whatſoever, to try any new expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, either upon Rich or Poor; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inwardly or outwardly; thus much for the Book. Now as for what concerns your ſelves; I would have you by all means to have a reſpect to two things above all, your Conſciences and Credits; and principally to the firſt; and to that end, for all the Treaſure in the World, to give no Medicine to cauſe a Woman to miſcarry of her Child; but prudently ſend ſuch kind of People to the Learned Phyſitian to deal with: and that you may proſper in your Practiſe, diſcharge your duty as well to the Poor as Rich. Have a great care whom you lay in your Houſes, for fear of encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:34775:4"/> naughty Women; Laſtly I would adviſe you not to be diſmay'd if every thing in your practiſe fall not out juſt at the very inſtance of your expectation, you performing your part; but expect the event with patience; for fear diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Senſes, and Perſons that keep their wits together without ſuffering them to be ſcattered thereby, are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Counſelling in the moſt weighty Affairs. And now I ſhall no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you in the Porch, but deſire you will forthwith be pleaſed to walk into the Palace; where I queſtion not but you will find wherewith to ſatisfie your Curioſity in what concerns the premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and ſo wiſhing you all the Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty imaginable; I bid you Adieu.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34775:12"/> his vein, and in the ſame part another vein ariſeth, called, by ſome, the immoveable, or quiet vein; becauſe, according to the account of the pulſation of other veins it beats not at all, but lies quiet; ordained for this end, that it ſhould let go the pureſt blood to the Lungs, being veſted with a double tunicle like an Arterie, from whence it is called the Arterial vein. But in the left concavity of the heart there are two Arteries, that is to ſay, the Venal Arterie, and the Great Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which carries a great pulſe with it, and diffuſeth the vital Spirits by the blood of the heart into all the Arteries of the Body. For, as the hollow vein is the original of all veins, by which the Body doth attract its whole nouriſhment of blood; ſo, from the <hi>Aorta</hi> (or great Arterie) all pulſatile veins are derived, diffuſing the vital Spirits through the whole Body. For the heart is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and original of vital heat, without which no creature or member can thrive.</p>
                  <p>Under the aboveſaid Arterie in the left concavity of the heart, another vein ariſeth called the Venal Arterie: And, although that be really a pulſatile vein, and doth direct the vital Spirits, yet, according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of all pulſatile veins that have blood, it hath but one coat, and therefore made for that end, that it ſhould derive the cold air
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34775:12"/> from the Lungs to refreſh the heart, as alſo to attemper its over-much heat.</p>
                  <p>And veins iſſuing out from both the cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the heart, are inſerted into the Lungs, of which they are formed; for the vein that proceeds from the right cavity of the heart produceth the moſt ſubtile blood, which, by ſmall fibres, diſperſed here and there, is changed into the fleſhy ſubſtance of the lungs. But from the great vein of the Liver, (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> or hollow vein) the whole breſt is generated, and ſo ſucceſſively the Arms and Thighs.</p>

                  <p>Within the time aforeſaid alſo is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the higheſt and chiefeſt part of this noble ſtructure, the Brain; in the third Region of this maſs; for the whole maſs of ſeed is filled with the animal Spirits, that contracts a great part of the genital moyſture, and concludes it in a certain cavity wherein the brain may be formed: but, as to the out-fide, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veloped with a certain covering, which being dried with heat, is brought into a boney ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and becomes a ſcull, as appears by this precedent figure.</p>
                  <p>But the brain is ſo formed, that it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, retain, and change the natures of all the vital Spirits, from whence alſo proceed the beginnings of all Reaſon, and of the Senſes: For, as veins have their original from the Liver, and as arteries have their riſe from the heart; ſo alſo nerves being of a ſofter and milder natural exiſtence, ariſe from the brain, and are not hollow as the veins are, but ſolid; for they are the firſt and chiefeſt inſtruments of all the ſenſes, by which the motions of all the ſenſes, by reaſon of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſpirit, are juſtly made.</p>
                  <p>After the nerves, from the brain alſo, is formed the pith of the back-bone, not of an unlike nature from the brain, ſo that it ſcarce can be called marrow becauſe it hath no likeneſs to marrow, either by ſight, or in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34775:13"/> ſubſtance; for the marrow is a kind of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous aliment, ariſing from the blood of the members, appointed to moiſten and make the bones of the body grow; but the brain and pith of the back have their original from the ſeed, not deputed for the nouriſhment and growth of the other members, but that by themſelves they might make private parts of the body, for the uſe and motion of the Senſes, that from thence all the other nerves may take their riſe. For, from the pith of the back many nerves ariſe, from which the body hath ſenſe and motion, as may appear by the difference betwixt the vital and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal faculties, as hath been before hinted.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, here it is to be obſerved, that from the ſeed it ſelf griſtles, bones, coats of the veins of the Liver, and of the arteries of the heart, the brain with the Nerves, and again the tunicles, and as well other panni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles or membranes as thoſe that wrap up the infant, are generated; but from the proper blood of the infant is the fleſh it ſelf ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and all thoſe parts that are of a fleſhy ſubſtance; as the Heart, the Liver, and Lungs: And then at length all theſe grow together by the menſtruous blood, attracted by the ſmall veins of the Navil, which are obſerved to be directed with their orifices into the Womb.

                  <head>SECT. II. Of the ſigns of Conception, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Child thrive in the Womb.</head>
                  <p>
                     <label>DR.</label> Good Mrs. <hi>Eutrapelia,</hi> vouchſafe me your obſervations about Conceptions, and let me underſtand what are the ſigns of Conception in general; and what ſigns di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the Sexes?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mid.</hi> Although, Sir, 'tis hard to know whether a woman hath conceived yea or no, yet it may be conjectured by many experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Arguments; as, for inſtance,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is thought a credible ſign of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, if a woman either the tenth day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter coition, or ſooner, perceive not, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of any humors, any of her terms, be they whites, or reds. And, though the ſtopping of thoſe be accounted for a ſign, yet that fails often, becauſe it may be as well before conception as after. But, waving this, let us find out other marks and prognoſticks of a true conception, gathered from the ſtate and condition of the woman her ſelf, being ſeriouſly examined from head to foot.</p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:34775:16"/>
                  <p>Secondly; pains and giddineſs in the head, and a miſt over the ſight, if they meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, theſe portend conception.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the apples of the Eyes are leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Eyes ſwell, and become ſwarthy; the veins of the Eyes grow red, and are full with blood; the Eyes ſink, the Eye-lids are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs; divers colors are ſeen in the Eyes, and are obſerved in a looking-glaſs; the veins betwixt the Eyes and the Noſe are ſwoln with blood, and are ſeen clearer; the veins under the Tongue are ſomewhat green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the cheſt is warm, and the back cold.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the Veins and Arteries are ſwoln, and the pulſe eaſier; the veins in the breaſt are firſt black, then either yellow or blew.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The breaſts grow big, and hard with pain; the nipple grows red; if ſhe drinketh that which is cold, ſhe feels cold in her breaſt.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, there is a great loathing of meat and drink, and deſtruction of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral appetite, with longings after various meats, with an abſurd appetite, a continual vomiting, and weakneſs of ſtomach, ſower belching, loathing of wine, an inordinate pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the heart, ſudden joy, and after that, as ſudden grief; pains about the navil, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34775:16"/> about the loins, ſwelling towards the bottom of the belly; inward prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the body; chilneſs of the outward parts, after coition; retention of the ſeed ſeven daies after copulation; about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of conception a ſhooting pain about the back and belly. The courſes are ſtop'd; for thoſe veins from which they flow carry the blood (through certain holes that are at the end of them) for the nouriſhment of the infant by the navil; and part of it is conveyed upwards into the breaſts, and there is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for milk.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, the thighs ſwell with pain, but the body is weaker, and the face pale.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly; the belly is coſtive, by reaſon of the compreſſure of the inteſtines. The urine is white, with a cold ſwimming at the top, wherein are to be ſeen many atomes, like thoſe obſervable in the beams of the ſun: but, when in the firſt Month many of theſe ſink to to the bottom, the veſſel in which it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhaken, it ſeems to be drawn out like to wooll. In the later months the urine is red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, or yellow, it becomes blackiſh, with a red cloud at the top. I will here-with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to you two experiments, by which it may be known whether or no a woman hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. And the firſt is this; Stop up a womans urine three daies in an urinal, at the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34775:17"/> end of which ſtrain it (or, rather drop it through fine linnen,) and if ſhe hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, you ſhall ſee little creatures like to lice; if theſe be red, 'tis a token of a male; but if white, they ſay portend a female. If a womans urine be put in a braſs Baſon, and ſtand there one night; if you put into it a bright needle, if ſhe hath conceived, that needle will be beſpeckled with red ſpots; but if otherwiſe, it will be ruſty all over.</p>
                  <p>The Signs whereby moſt pretend to know, whether Male or Female be conceived, being altogether Falacious and Ridiculous, I have wholly omitted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Dr.</label> Since you have given ſuch ſigns of Conception, let me know by what ſigns you apprehend the Infant to be well, and thrive in the Womb, or not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Mid.</label> I ſhall, Sir. And firſt, if it be well, the breaſts will be hard; but if otherwiſe, they will be flaccid, and a wateriſh humor will flow out of them (like to milk) of its own accord.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if the courſes flow too often out of the Womb in the time of child-bearing, it is an argument of an unhealthy Child, And, moreover, the fatteſt Women com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly bring forth the weakeſt Infants.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if a woman bring Twins, the one a Male, the other a Female, there is great
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34775:17"/> danger of the Female, becauſe they are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by a different aliment in the Womb: but if they be both Females, there is the leſs danger.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if the Child be gotten in the time of the monthly terms, they are mixed with untoward humors; from whence it is experienced that many leprous Infants are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, if there be <hi>ſuperfaetation,</hi> the laſt conception ſeldom liveth. Now, <hi>ſuperfaeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is, when a Woman having once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, conceiveth again after a certain time, which ſometimes happeneth.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, if a Dropſie overtake the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellied Woman, and that her Noſe, Ears, and Lips look red; it is a ſign of a dead Child.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, if the infant come forth after the ninth month, 'tis oftentimes very weak.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, if a virgin conceive before her firſt flowers, it proves luſty and perfect child.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Dr.</label> So much for Conception. Tell me now ſomewhat of the nouriſhing of the Child in the Womb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <head>SECT. III. Of the Nutriment of the Child in the Womb, and by what nouriſhment it is preſerved, and when it groweth up to be an Infant.</head>
                  <p>WHileſt the young one is in the womb, it is nouriſhed by blood attracted by the navil; by which it is, that women af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have conceived have their terms ſtop'd; for then the infant begins to crave, and attracts much blood. For the blood, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after-conception, is diſcerned by a three-fold difference. The firſt and pureſt part of it the young one attracts for nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The ſecond, leſs pure and thin, the wombforceth upwards by certain veins to the breaſts, where it becomes milk, by which the infant is nouriſhed ſo ſoon as it is born. The third, and more impure part of the blood, remains in the womb, and floweth out with the ſecundine, both in the birth, and after the birth: Hence it is that <hi>Hippocates</hi> ſaith; there is much affinity betwixt the flowers and the milk, ſince the one happeneth to be made out of the other. And <hi>Galen</hi> alſo, by reaſon
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34775:18"/> of this thing, elegantly adviſeth, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant hath more from the mother than from the father; for this reaſon, becauſe the ſeeds are firſt increaſed by the menſtruous blood, and then by theſe the Infant is preſently nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the Womb; and again, being new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly born, it is nouriſhed with milk: And, as roots have more nouriſhment from the earth than the plant from whence they came: ſo alſo Infants receive more from the Mother than from the Father. And hence he ſaith that it comes to paſs, that ſo much more is attributed to the Mother, by how much more She contributeth more towards generation.</p>

                  </figure>
                  <p>If the Infant be formed in 45 days, it will ſtir in 90 days, which is the middle time that it lies hid in the Womb; for in the ninth month it will come forth, and make haſte to the birth; although Females are oftentimes born in the tenth Month. And ſo much for the formation, increaſe, and perfection of the Infant, according to the account of days and times.</p>

               <div n="4" type="section">

                  <head>SECT. IV. How the Infant doth in the Womb the fifth, the ſixth, the ſeventh, and eighth month; and of the due time and form of the Birth; and cauſes of pain in Child-birth.</head>
                  <p>AFter the third and fourth month the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant uſeth a more plentiful nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which it groweth more and more until the time of Birth ſhall come: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is to be underſtood, that when it is born in the ſixth month, it cannot, in nature, live; becauſe, though it be formed diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet it is not arrived to its juſt perfection. But if it be born in the ſeventh month, it may eaſily live, becauſe then it is ſufficiently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. And, whereas 'tis a common opinion thoſe born in the eighth month can rarely live; but ſuch as are born in the ſeventh are often times living, becauſe on the ſeventh month the Infant is ever moving towards the Birth, at which time, if it be ſtrong enough, it comes to the Birth, but if not, it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Womb till it groweth ſtronger,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34775:20"/> 
                     <hi>(viz.)</hi> the other two Months. After the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at ſeven Months end if it be not born, it removes it ſelf into ſome other place of the Womb, and is ſo weakned by that motion, that ſhould it come to the birth in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eighth Month, it cannot live by reaſon of that motion.</p>
                  <p>This ſeems very probable to many, but if they that practiſe deliveries make a rational reflection thereon, they ſhall find that 'tis the Matrix alone aſſiſted with the compreſſion of the Muſcles of the lower belly and Midriff, which cauſe the expulſion of the Child; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtirred up by its weight, and not able to be farther extended to contain it: and not the Infant for want of nouriſhment is not able to ſtay any longer there, and ſo uſeth its pretended endeavours to come forth; and to that purpoſe kicking ſtrongly it, breaks the Membranes with its Feet which contain the waters, inſomuch as when the Child is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Born the skins are alwaies torn before the Head; which preſſing and thruſting each through the waters before it, cauſeth them to burſt out with force. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> admits the 10 month, and beginning of the 11. And here, I do acknowledge for truth that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary term of going with Child is 9 months; but I cannot conſent that Children born in the 7 month do oftener live than thoſe born
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34775:21"/> in the 8, but on the contrary, I believe the nearer they approach to the term of 9 months the ſtronger they are, and therefore rather live then thoſe born in the 7th, which is wholly contrary to the other opinion which they have from <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> and in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> and other places Children born in the 8th month live. But they ſhould have conſidered there may be ſome difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s Months, <hi>viz.</hi> whether they were <hi>Solar</hi> or <hi>Lunar,</hi> a <hi>Solar</hi> conſiſting of 30 or 31 days throughout the year, and a <hi>Lunar</hi> of 27 days and ſome odd Hours and odd Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes.</p>
                  <p>And then again the Women might be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in their reckoning. And do we not know not only in the ſame Country and Field but alſo on the ſame Vine, grapes ſometimes ſix weeks ripe before their ordinary Seaſon; and others not till a month after? which happens according to the Territories, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent influence of the Sun, and as the Vine is ordered. So do we ſee Women brought to bed ſix weeks and 2 months before, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as long after their ordinary term; if it be not that the Womb not being capable of an extenſion beyond a certain degree, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear its burden, but a little while after the account is out; although there have been Women as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> acknowledgeth who
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34775:21"/> have gone 10 or 11 whole Months with Child, which is ſo much the rarer, by how much it exceeds its limits.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things happen alſo to Women ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different diſpoſitions, either of their whole body, or Womb alone, as well as according to their rule of living, and more or leſs exerciſe they uſe, and may alſo happen on the Childs part, as if at 7 months it be ſo big that the Womb can no longer contain it, nor ſtretch it ſelf more without burſting, it is then provoked by the pain which this violent extention cauſeth to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it ſelf of it; and ſo in the 8th month if there be the ſame reaſon, and ſome weeks ſooner or later according to many other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; as alſo by an outward occaſion, as a violent ſhaking of the whole body, blow, fall, leap, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> haſting the pains; and that which makes theſe Children live a longer or ſhorter time, is according as they are at that time more ſtrong and perfect, and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nearer her time which is at the end of the 9th month.</p>
                  <p>There have been many Women that have believed they were brought to bed at the 7th and 8th Month; and others that they went 10 or 11 whole Months; which may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be when notwithſtanding they are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectively delivered at the due time: that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34775:22"/> which deceives them uſually is their believing themſelves with Child from the retention of their Courſes, having had them the 2 firſt Months, yea and ſometimes longer, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers miſreckon when their Courſes are ſtopt 2 Months before they conceive: And a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, though well regulated, cannot exactly know by the ſuppreſſion ſingly the certain time of her being with Child; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if ſhe lye with her Husband upon the coming down of her Courſes, and ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive upon it, then ſhe may make her account from their ſuppreſſion, which may be very near the truth; but if ſhe conceive immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after ſhe hath had them, which happens oftneſt, and that during the Month ſhe Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates with her Husband, at the end of which time her Courſes not coming down, ſhe may very well reckon her ſelf with Child, yet for all this ſhe cannot know by this ſign which Night ſhe conceived on, and ſo for 3 weeks or a Month, more or leſs, ſhe may be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the time.</p>
                  <p>Here note there hath often been great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts amongſt Phyſitians, whether a Child born the 11th or 12th Month, after its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Fathers death, can be legitimately born, and ſo admitted to inherit, or be diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited, as a ſuppoſed Child; but this having been debated by the <hi>Romans</hi> as well as us, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34775:22"/> being parties for and againſt, I ſhall leave it undecided, and ſhall not add any thing more concerning this point to what I have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>And now the Midwife is to take care, that ſhe be timely prepared for the reception of any birth, with all her neceſſary conveniences and inſtruments, as with a fit ſtool, a ſharp knife, aſtringent powder, a ſpunge, ſwathes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> warm oyl of Lillies, with which ſhe may aptly anoint both the Womb of the Woman and her own hands, but of that more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>And now in the next place let us make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry for the fitteſt and beſt Midwife, for this great work, and now I remember my ſelf there was a good Woman call'd Mrs. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapelia</hi> with me laſt night, for my advice and counſel in a very difficult concern, whom I found by that little diſcourſe I had with her to be a very rational and underſtanding and expert woman in her art, and one that was not ſelf conceited of her ſelf, like many of her Siſters, that think they know all, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve 'tis below them to ask any advice of the learned Phyſitian or Chyrurgion, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are ofteneſt the moſt ignorant; for 'tis the Phyſitian and Chyrurgion that they muſt be obliged to for the chief part of their Art, and in <hi>France</hi> 'tis the Chyrurgions

                  <head>SECT. V. Rules for Child-bearing Women, and how to prevent Abortion.</head>
                  <p>
                     <label>MId.</label> According to your promiſe, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, Doctor, lay me down ſome Rules to be obſerved by Child-bearing Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Dr.</label> Good Midwife, I ſhall, and that very neceſſary ones too, that ſhe may know how to go on ſafely through (by Gods bleſſing) to the laſt hour, or by neglecting them, may make her delivery the harder: and I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them under ten heads.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, let her be chearful; for this doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilarate the Infant, and ſtirs up all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and confirms it in its parts and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let her avoid all violent moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ahſtain from all hard labours, not riſing up too haſtily, not leaping, running, dancing, riding; not lacing her ſelf too ſtreight, or carrying too heavy a burden; but ſurely moderate ſleep and reſt, is very fit for her. And all this eſpecially toward the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of her reckoning; for though it be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34775:25"/> allowed them by moſt Authors to facilitate the Birth, yet if we well conſider the point we ſhall without doubt find it to be the cauſe of miſcarryings, and hard labors, and death of many Women and Children. For you muſt know that the Birth of a Child ought to be left to the work of Nature well regulated, and not to provoke it, by ſhaking and jolting, as in a Coach, or by a trotting Horſe, and to diſlodge it before its full time, which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing though it be but 7 or 8 days ſooner proves ſometimes as prejudicial to the Infant, as we ſee it ſometimes to Grapes which we find 4 or 5 days before they are full ripe, to be yet almoſt half verjuice; But to explain this more clearly, conſider the Infant is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſeated in the Womb, with Head up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt and the Feet downwards, with its Face towards the Mothers belly, juſt till it hath attained the 8th Month; at which time and ſometimes ſooner, and ſometimes later, its head being very great and heavy, it turns over its Head downward and its heels up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; which is the ſole and true poſture in which it ought to come into the World. Now juſt when the Child is about to turn according to cuſtome into its intended po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, inſtead of giving her ſelf reſt, ſhe fall a jumping, walking, running up and down ſtaires, and exerciſing her ſelf more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34775:26"/> which very often cauſes it to turn croſs, and not right, as it ought to be; and ſometimes the Womb is depreſſed to low, and engaged in ſuch ſort towards the laſt Month, in cavity of the flanks by thoſe jolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that there is no liberty left the Infant to turn it ſelf naturally; wherefore it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to come in its firſt poſture, to wit by the Feet, or ſome other worſer: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it would be very convenient that the Woman ſhould abſtain from having to do with a Man carnally, during the 2 laſt months of her reckoning, foraſmuch as the body is thereby much moved, and the belly preſſed in the action, which likewiſe cauſeth the Child to take a wrong poſture. Now I believe that thoſe that will ſeriouſly reflect and confider of theſe things, will be ready to quit this their old error, which hath certainly cauſed the death of many Women and Children, and much pain to divers others.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, let her beware of ſharp and cold winds, of exceſſive heat, anger, troubles of the mind, affrights and terrors, over-much venery, and of intemperancy of eating and drinking.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly let her diet be frugal, and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, abſtaining from groſs meats, hard of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion; let her eat Eggs, Chickens, Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fowl, birds of the Mountains, &amp;c. variety
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34775:26"/> of broths, grewels, panadoes, Mutton, Veal, Lamb, Kid, Rabbets; ſhe may uſe in her meats Nutmeg and Cinnamon; ſhe may drink wine moderately.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, in the firſt four Months let her open no vein, uſe no cupping or ſcarrificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, fontanells, nor uſe any pills, or other Phyſick, without the advice of a prudent Phyſitian; for in theſe Months the liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Child are very tender, ſoft, and feeble; and therefore the eaſier deſtroyed, and the nouriſhment kept from it.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, if it ſhall happen that the Woman be too coſtive (by which many miſcarry) let her boyl Spinage, and Lettuce, in Veal broth well buttered, with ſalt, or wine; which, if they will not move the belly, let her uſe ſuppoſitories, with honey and ſalt, or of <hi>Caſtile</hi>-ſoap: and if theſe common things will not do, let her adviſe with an expert Phyſitian.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, if it happen that ſhe conceive with grievous ſymptoms, and after concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is troubled with faintings, let her take this Cordial following. Take of Sorrel-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and red-Roſe-water, of each one ounce; of Cinamon-water one ounce; of <hi>Manus Chriſti</hi> pearled, half an ounce, or as much <hi>Diamargariton:</hi> this may be taken as need requires.</p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:34775:27"/>
                  <p>Eighthly, if ſhe fear that ſhe may come (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her time) as in the ſeventh Month, or ſome other unſeaſonable time, and feels throws, as of Child-bearing, let her ſit over a fume of Frankincenſe; for that contributes no ſmall ſtrength both to the Womb, and to the Infant alſo.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, if ſhe nauſeate her meat, ſhe may uſe a plaiſter of Maſtich to her Stomach, and take this following Cordial every morning, faſting, to ſtrengthen her Stomach.</p>
                  <p>Take Syrup of Pomegranates one ounce and half; of Moſch and Ambergreece, of each two grains; of <hi>Lignum</hi> Aloes finely powdered, one ſcruple; of Cinamon half a ſcruple; the water of Sorrel three ounces; let theſe be mingled, and drank off blood-warm.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if, whilſt ſhe go with Child, ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her terms, let her eat milk, made boyl with red-hot ſteel, and in that let Plantain and Comfrey be boyled. But, in all theſe caſes, let her adviſe with learned Phyſitians, which will direct her with medicines from time to time.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall hereafter treat of ſome diſtempers incident to Child-bed; and leave you ſome choice Remedies in the following Sections; and then wind up all.</p>

                     <label>MId.</label> A good morning to you good Mr. Dr. Sir I am come according to my promiſe, to give you an account of the event of the directions you was pleaſed to give me laſt Night concerning Mrs. <hi>Styles,</hi> the which indeed Sir have ſucceeded marveilous proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, and ſhe now thinks her ſelf in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe to what ſhe was before, and hath ſent you Sir a ſmall gratuity according to her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, in acknowledgment of the great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit ſhe hath received by your Counſel. And for my own part Sir I ſo well approve of your laſt Nights diſcourſe, that I muſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly entreat you, that you would be pleaſed to afford me your Inſtructions in the ſafe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of my Art.</p>

                  <p>The beſt Midwife is ſhe that is ingenious, knowing letters, and having a good memory, is ſtudious, neat and cleanly over the whole body, healthful, ſtrong, and laborious, and well inſtructed in Womens conditions: not ſoon angry, nor turbulent, or haſty, unſober, unchaſte; but pleaſant, quiet, prudent; not covetous, but like the Hebrew Midwives, ſuch as fear God, that God may deal with them, and that people may multiply and increaſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their hands, and that the Lord may build them Houſes.</p>
                  <p>By this deſcription I tell you only how the beſt Midwife muſt be qualified; now let me hear ſomewhat of your skill, that I may the better judge thereof. Firſt, then let me know how Women are delivered?</p>

                  <head>SECT. VII. Of the ſeveral natural ſituations of the Infant in the Mothers Womb, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different times of Child-bearing.</head>
                  <p>WHen the Woman is young with Child, the little creature call'd the <hi>Embryo</hi> is always of a round Figure, a little longiſh, having the back-bone moderately turn'd inwards, the thighs folded and a little raiſed, to which the legs are ſo joined, that the heels touch the buttocks; the arms are bending and the hands placed upon the knees, towards which the head is inclining forwards, ſo that the chin toucheth the breaſt; In this poſture it reſembles one ſitting to void his excrements, and ſtooping down his head to ſee what comes from him. Its back bone is at that time placed towards the Mothers, the head uppermoſt, the face forward, and the feet downward; and proportionably to its growth, it extends its members by little and little; which were exactly folded in the firſt Month; This poſture it uſually keeps till the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34775:34"/> 7th or 8th month, at which time the head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown big is carryed downwards by its weight, towards the inward orifice of the Womb, tumbling as it were over its head, ſo that then the Feet are uppermoſt, and the Face towards the Mothers great gut; when the poſture happens otherwiſe, 'tis unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; (and both Male and Female lie thus;) becauſe the Child's face coming upwards will be extreamly bruiſed, and its Noſe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flatted, becauſe of the bones hardneſs in the paſſage.</p>
                  <p>Note further, when the Child hath chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its firſt Situation being not yet accuſtomed to this laſt, it ſtirs and torments it ſelf ſo much ſometimes, that the woman, by reaſon of the pain ſhe feels, is apt to believe ſhe is in labor, and if this circumſtance be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, you will find it to be that firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended indeavour, which Authors imagine the Child makes to be born the 7th month; and not being able to accompliſh it, it ſtays till the 9th &amp;c. But this is a great miſtake, for if the Child turns it ſelf ſo with the head downwards, or rather is turned, it is but by a natural diſpoſition of the weight of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per parts of the body; and if it ſtir much at that time and ſoon after, it is not from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be born, but from the inconvenience it receives from this new poſture, to which
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34775:34"/> it was not before accuſtomed: and it begins to turn thus ſometimes from the 7th month, rarely before, but by accident; often about the 8th and ſometimes the 9th only, and at other times alſo it doth not turn at all, as we may eaſily perceive in thoſe that come in their firſt Situation, that is with their Feet fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</p>
                  <p>When there are many Children they ought to come in the ſame Figure if it be a natural Birth, as when there is but one; but uſually by their different motions they incommode one another, that for the moſt part one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents wrong in time of labour; yea and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which is the cauſe that one comes often with the head, the other with the feet, or ſome worſe poſture, and ſometimes both come wrong. However the Infant may be ſettled in the Mothers belly, or in whatever faſhion it repreſents it ſelf at the birth, if it be not according to the poſture before ſaid, it is always againſt nature.</p>

                  <head>SECT. VIII. Of difficult births, whether they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Cauſes external or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</head>
                  <p>DIfficult births from external cauſes may be either, firſt, from exceſſive heat, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving the ſtrength of the women; or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, exceſſive cold, condenſing the womb; or thirdly, from ſweet things, often applied to the noſtrils of the woman, that by ſmelling to ſweet things ſhe may recover her ſtrength and faintings; for ſweet ſmells do attract the womb upwards, and ſo render the birth more difficult.</p>
                  <p>Difficult birth from internal cauſes may be either, firſt, from the woman; ſecondly, from the womb; thirdly, from the infant; fourthly from the membranes of the womb. 1. From the woman, as when ſhe is too an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, too fearful, or too modeſt; or if ſhe be in age above 40 years, from whence the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the womb may be concluded to be dry, and ſo the leſs extenfible; or when ſhe is ſo thick and fat, that the paſſages be narrow:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34775:35"/> Or, 2. From the womb it ſelf, as, when it is ſo ſmall, and nature ſo weak and feeble that it cannot expell the birth: Or, if there be any inflammation; or unnatural affect in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, be it the ſtone, or piles, or extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary coſtiveneſs; all which may ſo compreſs the womb with their weight, that it cannot expel the birth. 3. Is from the infant it ſelf, as if it be of an unuſual bigneſs, of a great head, or a monſtrous birth, hydropical, full of wind, dead in the womb, or lying there in a poſture beyond nature; as when it comes overthwart, with the feet forward, and not the head, or if the thigh before the head. 4. From the membranes of the womb, as when they are ſo forcibly broken by the child in the womb that the moyſture floweth thence, leaving the infant behind, that when the child ſhould come forth, that moyſture fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and ſo the membranes being dryer, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the birth the more difficult; or when it is firm and ſolid that it is broken with much difficulty, and ſo makes the labour the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>And here we cannot but take notice how thoſe Authors, who have not the perfect knowledge of the parts of a Womans body, attained to by Anatomy, do admire and cannot as they ſay, conceive how it is poſſible that an Infant ſo big can paſs, in time of labour,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34775:36"/> through an opening of the Womb ſo ſmall; ſome of them being of opinion that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſhare-bone is ſeperated at that time, to enlarge the paſſage; without which it would be impoſſible for the Infant to have room e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be born; and therefore Women that are a little antiquated ſuffer in their firſt labors more than others, becauſe their ſhare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone cannot ſo eaſily be ſeperated, which often kills their Children in their paſſage: others again are of opinion that it is the flank-bone, which is disjointed from the hoop-bone for the ſame purpoſe; and ſay both the one and the other of them, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe bones thus ſeparated at the hour of labor, are thereto ſo diſpoſed by degrees, a little before, by the fly my humors which flow forth from about the Womb, and then mollifie the griſles and cords which at other times join them firmly together. But both theſe opinions are as different from truth as reaſon; for Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my convinceth us clearly that the Womb by no means toucheth theſe places; whereby to moiſten and ſoften them by its humors; as likewiſe that theſe bones are ſo joined by the griſtle that it is very difficult to ſeperate them with a knife, eſpecially the flank-bone from the hoop-bone, and almoſt impoſſible in ſome elderly Women without great violence; although <hi>Ambroſe Parry,</hi> a moſt famous Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34775:36"/> in his time at <hi>Paris,</hi> (quoting many witneſſes to the thing) gives us an Hiſtory of a Woman in whom (having been hang'd 14 days after ſhe was delivered in Child-birth,) he found (as he ſaith) the ſhare bone ſeparated in the middle the bredth of half a finger, and the flanck-bones them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves disjointed from the hoop-bone. But we will not in this matter accuſe him of an impoſture as having too much reſpect, and a better opinion of ſo worthy a perſon, and believing him to be too ſincere as to commit ſuch a crime; but do indeed believe the good man might be miſtaken in this ſeparation; for we cannot probably conceive that being ſo at the time of her labor it would remain ſo a fortnight after, the breadth of half a finger; for then they would have been forc'd to carry this Woman to execution; (for they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted at <hi>Paris</hi> within the City or Suburbs,) becauſe ſhe would not have been able to have ſupported her ſelf, or climbe the ladder of the Gibbet; and keep her ſelf on her Legs according to the cuſtome of other Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors; becauſe the body is only ſupported by the ſtability of theſe bones; wherefore we muſt believe, as moſt probable, that ſuch a disjunction and ſeparation was cauſed either from the falling of this Womans body from the high Gibbet to the ground after executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34775:37"/> or from ſome blow on that place from ſome hard thing. And if we thoroughly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the different Figure and Structure of theſe bones between a Mans and a Womans <hi>Sceleton,</hi> we ſhall find a larger empty ſpace and diſtance between theſe bones much more conſiderable in women then in men; and that to this purpoſe the leaſt women have the bones of the hip more diſtant the one from the other, than the biggeſt man; and they have alſo the crupper-bone more outwards, and the ſharebone flatter, which makes the paſſage from this capacity larger, and more able to give iſſue to the child at the time of labour: moreover they have beſides this the flank bones much more turned outward, that the womb being filled may have more room to ſtretch it ſelf out on the ſides, and more at eaſe ſupported by ſuch a diſpoſition; as you will ſee explain'd in the figure.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>ſhews the Man's bones.</hi> B <hi>the Womans; for to know the difference that the Womans is more capacious then the Mans, for</hi> C <hi>and</hi> C, D <hi>and</hi> D, E <hi>and</hi> E <hi>are at a larger diſtance one from another, in a Woman than in a Man. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that Women have the rump bone marked</hi> F. <hi>more turned outwards than Men, which gives way to the head to paſs through the large paſſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the</hi> 2 <hi>Hip-bones, marked</hi> E <hi>and</hi> E, <hi>without great difficulty; and without any neceſſity for the ſeparation of the ſhare-bone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:34775:37"/>
                  <p>The bladder and great gut being emptyed of the excrements they contein hinder, in no wiſe but that the womb, made membranous or skinny for that purpoſe, can ſtretch forth it ſelf as it doth to let the infaut paſs in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, by this great empty ſpace ſufficient for it whithout any neceſſity that theſe bone-ſhould be disjointed or ſeparated; for if it ſhould ſo fall out indeed women could not ſuſtain themſelves on their legs; as many of them do immediately after that they are brought to bed; becauſe they are inſtead of a ſupport to them, as is already expreſt, and of a middle joincture to all the other, as well of the upper as the lower parts of the body. Which the learned and judicious and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Chirurgion Mr. <hi>Francis Moriceau</hi> very well noted, when he lay'd ſo many Women in the <hi>Hoſtel de dieu</hi> in <hi>Paris;</hi> for when Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that are there to be brought to bed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be in labor, they go into a little room call'd the ſtove, where all are delivered upon a little low bed made expreſly, where they place them before the fire, afterwards as ſoon as they are delivered they conduct them to their bed, which ſometimes is a good way off from this little chamber, whither they walk very well, which they could never do were their ſhare-bone, or their flanck-bone ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the one from the other. Beſides we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34775:38"/> ſee young Women that have concealed their labour, put themſelves (the better to hide their faults,) immediately to their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary buſineſs as if they had ailed nothing: neither could this ingenious Chyrurgion, in all women that ever he delivered, ever perceive this pretended disjunction, though he put his hand on the ſhare bone when the child was in paſſage; but he ſayes that indeed he hath found the hip-bone which is joyned with a looſe Joint, to the lower extremity of the hoop-bone to bend outwards during labour: in which part the women feel ſometimes much pain becauſe the coming forth of the child of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it a great violence, and becauſe its head at that time doth much preſs the great gut againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Moreover having often ſeen and diſſected women, being dead a few days after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery, it hath been found a very difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſeperate theſe bones with a ſtrong ſharp Pen-knife; where could not be found any the leaſt appearance of any forgoing ſeparation: and if thoſe advanced in years have more pain with their firſt children than the younger women, it doth not proceed from the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſeperation of theſe bones (which never is, from the reaſon aforeſaid) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the membranes of their womb are dry, and hard; and particularly its internal orifice,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34775:38"/> cannot therefore ſo eaſily be ſtretched open as young womens, which in them is much moiſter.</p>

                  <p>THE poſtures of the infant in the womb are generally four: Firſt, they offer to come with their heads forward (which is the natural birth.) Secondly, with the feet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Thirdly, overthwart. Fourthly, doubled; to all which the Midwives care and skill is required, but eſpecially in the three later. But many other poſtures have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, in practice; for that child that comes with his head forward, ſometimes hath his head right, as to the orifice of the matrix, but the reſt of the body crooked, and ſometimes overthwart: and ſometimes the infant pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his head, either in the former part from the orifice, or backward, or comes crooked; and ſometimes alſo it is whithout any tye, as to the bottom of the matrix, and ſometimes with it; ſometimes alſo it puts forth one hand, or both, ſo as that they are twiſted above the head: ſometimes it cometh forward, with its
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34775:39"/> feet aſunder, and thoſe fixed in the parts of the womb; ſometimes the feet being doubled, it endeavours to come forth with the knees forward; ſometimes it is ſo doubled, that it ſhews forth its little buttocks like one that is ſitting; or contrarily may be ſo doubled, that you may find the ſoles of the feet joyned to the head in the orifice of the matrix; but thoſe that lye o'rethwart, ſomtimes lye on one ſide, and ſometimes with the face upwards, and ſomtimes downwards: But if there be twins, then that which preſenteth it ſelf fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, muſt be laid hold on, and the other put back. As to all which, the next following Sections will not only furniſh you with fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, but with directions. Hitherto having deſcribed the Midwife and her office, togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with the ſite of the infant in the womb, as natural; together with difficult births in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and their cauſes.

                  <p>
                     <label>Mid.</label> In this, I will take care to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Oyles, and convenient liniments, and only to help the coming forth of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, by anointing and cheriſhing it, leſt it go back again, but that it may come forth the ſame way as it began. But firſt of all I ſhall take care, that both arms of the infant ſo ſtretched downwards, be ſo ſecured by me,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34775:41"/> that the infant may not have power to draw them back again, but that I may compel it to come forth, after the very ſame manner: But if the infant breaking forth after this manner, and by reaſon of its bigneſs as well as his arms drawn down, be ſo ſtreightned by the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of the matrix, that of it ſelf it cannot wholly come to the birth; then the womb of the woman is to be anointed with oyl of Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, or ſweet Almonds, or hogs greaſe, &amp; ſome ſneezing Powder, blowed up he noſe, to help the ſending forth of the birth; and the womb gently to be compreſſed with both hands, that it tend not upwards, but downwards, as it ought, until it come forth entirely.</p>
                  <p>Here moſt Authors adviſe to change the Figure and place the head ſo that it may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it ſelf firſt to the birth; which is very difficult and almoſt altogether impoſſible to be performed; if we deſire to avoid the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that by ſuch violent endeavours both the Mother and the Child muſt inevitably be put into; and I wiſh they would have ſhown us any way how it might be ſafely acted; that we might have followed their examples wherefore 'tis better to draw it forth by the feet, then to venture a worſe accident by turning it.</p>
                  <p>Now to perform this the Midwife muſt have her Nails well pared and no rings on her
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34775:41"/> fingers, but her hands well anointed with Oyl or freſh Butter; then the woman being ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the beſt advantage let her gently put her hand into the entry of the Womb, which if it be not wide enough let her open it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little by degrees, with her fingers by ſpreading them one from the other after they are entred together, ſo continuing to do till it be ſufficiently enlarged, then finding the Child's feet let her draw it forth in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture following; but if there ſhall but one foot preſent it ſelf, then ſhe ſhall conſider whether it be the right or the left, and in what faſhion it comes; for thefe reflections will be a means to inform her, on what ſide the other may be, which as ſoon as ſhe knows let her ſeek for it, and then gently draw it forth together with the firſt; and then alſo let her be very careful and well aſſured that this 2d be not the foot of another Child; for if it ſhould chance to prove ſo, ſhe may ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſplit both Mother and Children then draw them forth: the which ſhe may eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it by ſliding her hand up the firſt leg and thigh to the twiſt, ſhe find both thighs joined together, and depending from one and the ſame body; and which is likewiſe without doubt the beſt means to find the other foot, when it comes but with one.</p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:34775:42"/>
                  <p>Being then ſecured of both the Childs feet, ſhe may draw them forth, and holding them together, ſhe may bring them by little and little in this manner, by taking hold of the Legs and Thighs aftewards, as ſoon as ſhe can come at them and drawing them ſo till the hips be come forth: in the mean time let her obſerve to wrap the parts in a ſingle nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, to the intent that her hands being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy greaſy ſlip or ſlide nor from the Infants body, which is very ſlippery, becauſe of the ſlimy humors which are all over it; and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her from taking faſt hold of it; which being done ſhe may on both ſides, with her hand, bring away the arms, being careful that the Belly and Face be downwards; leſt being upwards the Head be ſtopt by the chin over the ſhare-bone; ſo that if it be not ſo ſhe muſt turn it to that poſture; which is eaſily done if by taking hold of the body, when the breaſt and arms are forth, ſhe ſhall draw it with turning it in proportion, on that ſide it moſt inclines to, till it be as it ſhould be, that is with the Face downwards, and having brought it to the ſhoulders, let her loſe no time, (deſiring the Women at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to bear down) that ſo in drawing, the head at that very moment may take its places and not be ſtopt in its paſſage.</p>

But it were much better to thruſt back the Infant into the Womb, and to turn it to the right form,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34775:44"/> which may be done after this manner. Let the woman lye on her back upon a bed, with her buttocks raiſed higher, and her head low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; which done, I muſt ſwathe her belly upward gently, that I may drive back the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant again into the Womb, by which means it may give an occaſion of coming in another form; but above all, I muſt take care to turn the face of the Infant toward the back of the Mother, and then I muſt lift up the buttocks and things of the Infant toward the Navil of the Mother, that it may haſten toward a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful birth: and there cannot be a ſafer experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this caſe, (as I conceive) which is alſo moſt uſeful in ſuch births as come unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally.</p>

                  <p>Now to remedy this birth of the ſhoulders ſome adviſe that it ſhould be put back, to make way for the Infants head, that thereby it may be reduced to a natural birth, but it is much better, for the reaſons before alledged, to endavour to bring it by the Feet; the which dextrouſly to effect, the Midwife muſt thruſt the ſhoulder back a little with her hand, that ſo ſhe may have more liberty to introduce it into the Womb, and ſliding it then along the Childs body either by the belly or ſide, as ſhe ſhall find it eaſieſt, ſhe ſhall fetch the feet; and turning it bring them to the paſſage, and ſo ſhe ſhall deliver that Woman as is before directed.</p>
                  <p>If it be the back that preſents to the birth, it is likewiſe impoſſible it ſhould be born in in that poſture, what pains ſoever the Mother endures; and beſides the child having the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy folded inwards, and almoſt double, its

                  <p>But when the Child comes with the Breech forward, if it be ſmall, and the Mother big, having the paſſages very large, it may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, with a little help, be born ſo; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it comes double, yet its Thighs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing folded towards its belly, which is ſoft and gives way, it paſſeth without much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>Now as ſoon as the Midwife finds the Child to come with the Buttocks formoſt ſhe muſt not ſuffer it to engage lower in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; for it will not come after that manner, unleſs it be very ſmall; and the paſſage very large as we have ſaid; This being then in good time perceived, the Midwife muſt, if ſhe can thruſt back the breech, and ſliding up her hand along the thigh to the legs and feet of the Child, ſhe muſt bring them gently, one after another, forh of the Womb, by folding, ſtretching, wagging, and drawing them gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards the ſide; being careful not to wind them too much, or cauſe a diſtocation,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34775:47"/> and then let her draw forth the reſt of the body, as if it came with the feet formoſt.</p>
                  <p>I ſaid, Sir that the Midwife, perceiving the Child to come with its breech formoſt, ought to put it back, if ſhe can, for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it will be ſo far advanced, in the paſſage, that ſhe may ſooner deſtroy both Mother and Child then reduce it to the poſture aforeſaid, it being once ſo ſtrongly engaged; when this happens ſhe cannot by any means hinder it from coming in this poſture, in which its bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is ſo preſſed, that it often voids its ordure by its Fundament: however ſhe may much help this birth, by ſliding up one or 2 fingers of each hand on each ſide of the buttocks, for to introduce them into the groins; and having crooked them inward, ſhe muſt draw the breech juſt out to the thighs, and then by drawing it, and wagging it from ſide to ſide, ſhe will diſingage them from the paſſage; as alſo the feet and legs one after the other; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very careful of putting any part out of joint; and then ſhe may draw forth the reſt, as before is taught when it come with its feet foremoſt.</p>

                  <p>
                     <label>Dr.</label> Very well Mrs. <hi>Eutrapelia,</hi> this is your way; but now give me leave I pray you to give you my method in this caſe; when an Infant therefore preſents only one or both hands to the birth, or an arme ſometimes out to the Elbow, and many times to the ſhoulder, it is of the worſt and moſt dangerous poſtures a child can come in, as well for its ſelf as its mother; by reaſon of the violence the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife is forced to uſe both to the one and the other, in ſearching for the feet, which are very far off, by which I would always, in theſe caſes, have it turn'd and drawn forth; the which to do will often make the midwife ſweat in the midſt of winter, becauſe of the difficulty in this labor more then all the reſt, though ſome other of them are indeed more dangerous for the Infant, as when it preſents
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34775:52"/> the belly, and the Navil ſtring comes forth, but it is not ſo painful for the Midwife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the feet of the Infant, being near the paſſage, are not ſo hard to be found, as when it comes with a hand forward, for then they are high, and at the very bottom ſometimes of the womb; where the midwife muſt ſeek them to turn it and draw it forth as I ſhall now direct.</p>
                  <p>When therefore it preſents with one hand only, or a whole arm firſt it muſt by no means be pulled forth by that part, for it will be ſooner ſeparated and rent from the body then ſo brought forth; by reaſon a child is pluck'd obliquely and a croſs-way; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having placed the woman as is requiſite, the midwife muſt put back the Infants hand or arm, into the womb again: ſome Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives dip in cold water, or waſh it with a wet cloth, ſaying that the Infant will preſently draw it in, if it be living; but it is uſually ſo preſt and ingag'd in the paſſage, that this bad poſture, that it hath not liberty enough to draw back its hands ſo eaſily, being once come forth; wherefore the midwife muſt guide them back with her own, which ſhe muſt afterwards ſlide into the womb, under the child's breſt and belly ſo far till ſhe finds the feet, which ſhe muſt gently pull towards her, to turn it and draw it forth by them as
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:34775:52"/> before I directed; always remembring to act with as little violence as may be, which is much more eaſy, ſure and ſafe then to buſy ones ſelf in putting it to a natural ſituation.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon therefore as ſhe hath turn'd the child to the feet, if ſhe hath hold but of one, ſhe muſt ſearch for the other, that ſo ſhe may bring it to the firſt, when holding them both ſhe muſt govern herſelf afterwards in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the child into the World, as we directed you before when the child comes with its feet foremoſt.</p>
                  <p>But if the Arm be far advanced almoſt to the ſhoulder, and ſo big and ſweld as it will be if it be along while forth, that it cannot at all, or with out great difficulty be put back, then ſhe herſelf, or a Chirurgion being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſent for, if the child be certainly dead, muſt twiſt the arm twice or thrice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, till it be wholly ſeperated from the body, which it will eaſily be by reaſon of its tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that juſt in the joint of the ſhoulder with the ſhoulder blade; but be ſure the child be dead; elce what an horrible ſpectacle will it be to bring, as ſome have done, a poor child yet living into the World after the arm hath been cut off?</p>

If this courſe take not, I muſt bring the woman to bed, where, after ſhe hath lain quiet a while, I muſt proceed after the ſame manner as I have before delivered: and if this alſo be to no purpoſe, and that it neither be changed to another form, ſhe muſt be brought to the ſtool; and the womb, by the help of the women that are aſſiſtants, muſt be depreſſed on both ſides, and downwards: And (my hands being annointed as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, together with the Womb, and both the arms as they come) I muſt do what I can to joyn them together, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as it comes forth.

But, in this caſe I muſt not make too much haſte, leſt it fall into a worſer form; neither is it poſſible that a child ſhould be ſo born, without great loſs to the Mother and Infant; therefore, if it cannot be turned with the hand, ſhe muſt be brought to the bed, where, if ſhe be very weak, ſhe may be refreſhed with convenient meats and cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and then often proceeded with as is ſaid before, until the Infant ſhall come to a more commodious form of birth.</p>

                  <head>SECT. XXII. Of a birth wherein the Infant preſents the belly.</head>
                  <p>
                     <label>DR.</label> In the next place Mrs. Midwife, let me hear from you how you will help a woman in labour of a child when it preſents its belly firſt?</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Mid.</label> That you ſhall Sr. very willingly to the utmoſt of my skill.</p>
                  <p>And here Sr. I muſt note that the back-bone may eaſily be bent and turned forwards alit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but by no means backwards without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive violence. Wherefore the worſt and moſt dangerous figure that a child can offer to the birth, is the belly, or the breaſt, for then its body is conſtreined to bend back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and what ever throws or endeavours a woman makes to bring it forth it will never be accompliſh'd; for ſhe will ſooner periſh with her child then ever advance it in this poſture into the paſſage, wherefore 'tis in great danger if not timely ſuccourd; and in caſe it ſhould eſcape, which would be very ſtrange, it would be weak in the back along time after its birth: but that which aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:34775:59"/> the danger much more is that for the moſt part the Navil-ſtring comes forth when the Child comes with the belly; Therefore as ſoon as 'tis diſcover'd to be ſo, the Midwife muſt uſe the ſole remedy of drawing it forth by the feet, as ſpeedily as may be, in this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner.</p>
                  <p>Having placed the woman I muſt gently ſlide up my flat hand, being well anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the eaſier entrance, towards the midle of the childs breaſt, which I muſt thruſt back to turn it, this ſituation being already half turn'd, the feet being as neer to the paſſage as the head, when it repreſents the midle of the belly; then I muſt ſlip up my hand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the belly till I find the feet, which I muſt bring to the paſſage, to draw it forth in the ſame manner, as if it came with the feet fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; being very careful to keep the Face downwards which muſt alwaies be obſerved before the head can be drawn forth, for the reaſons before given which muſt never be forgotten.</p>
                  <p>And here likewiſe is to be noted that the Midwife muſt alwaies prooceed after one and the ſame manner in the deliveries when a Child comes with the breaſt, or belly.</p>
                  <p>But on the other hand I would have it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd, that when at any time an Infant comes with its ſide, it is impoſſible to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34775:59"/> as the two former; but yet it is not ſo much tormented, nor is its ſituation ſo cruel; for it may remain in it a longer time without dying, than in the two former, wherein it is much more as it were upon the rack than in this, in which poſture the body may be bended forwards, and not backwards, as in the other; but the Navil ſtring doth not come forth ſo eaſily, as when it comes with the belly firſt. And in this as in the other 2 births, the Midwife will find it the ſafeſt way to draw it forth by the feet; by puſhing back a little the Infants body with her hand, the better to introduce it, which ſhe may ſlide along its thighs till ſhe find the legs and feet by which ſhe muſt turn it, and afterwards draw it forth, as I ſaid even now: nor ought ſhe to amuſe her ſelf, in any of theſe 3 births, to place its head right, that it may come naturally, becauſe 'tis in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of dying in theſe unnatural poſitions, if not drawn forth with ſpeed, which can never be effected unleſs it be by finding the feet, as I have directed.</p>

                  <p>
                     <label>DR.</label> Now Mrs. <hi>Eutrapelia,</hi> I have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther queſtion to ask you, and that is this; ſuppoſe you were call'd to deliver a Woman in labor where you find the Childs head to thruſt forth the neck of the Womb before it, how would you go to work in ſuch a caſe, and what art would you uſe to deliver the Child with ſafety?</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Mid.</label> Why ſurely Sir, if we only have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Figure the Child comes in in this labor, we may call it a natural one; but if we ſhall, on the other hand, conſider either the diſpoſition of the Womb, which is in danger of coming quite forth of the paſſage, or the manner of drawing forth of the Infant, we ſhall find it to be not ſo altogether: for its head thruſting it forceably before it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily cauſe a falling out of the Womb, if the Woman be not skilfully ſuccoured in time, here may be ſeen the neck of the Womb
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:34775:60"/> bear forth before in great wrinkles according as the Child advanceth.</p>
                  <p>Now Women troubled with their bearing down of their Womb before they conceive, and thoſe whoſe Womb is very moiſt, are much ſubject to this accident, becauſe of the looſeneſs of the ſtrings.</p>
                  <p>The ſame method muſt not be obſerved here, as in the natural birth; for in this caſe the Woman muſt neither walk nor ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; but ſhe muſt keep her bed with her body equally at leaſt ſituated, and not raiſed a little as is requiſite in a natural labor. She muſt by no means uſe ſtrong or ſharp clyſters, leſt they procure too great throws, neither muſt her Womb be moiſtned, becauſe 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready too much looſened; but ſhe muſt be aided at the moment each pain takes her, when the Child begins to advance its head, and conſequently the neck of the Womb, and let the Midwife keep her hands on each ſide of its head, to thruſt back by reſiſting the Womans pains, the Womb only giving way in the mean time for the Child to advance, doing the like at every throw; continuing therein till the Woman of her ſelf hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Child quite into the World, for we muſt by no means draw it by the head, as in a natural labor, for fear of cauſing the Womb to fall out at the ſame time, to which it is then very apt.</p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:34775:61"/>
                  <p>Now if notwithſtanding the Infant having the head born, and yet ſtops there, ſo long as to endanger its ſuffocation, then the Midwife muſt call a ſecond perſon to her aſſiſtance, to draw it gently forth by the head, whilſt ſhe keeps back the Womb with both her hands, to prevent its following the Infants body ſo drawn forth. After the Woman is thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, and her. Afterbirth fetch'd away gently; and not ſhaking or drawing it away too rudely, then let the Womb be placed up in its natural ſituation if it bears down.</p>

                  <head>SECT. XXIV. How to deliver a Woman when the Child preſents the ſide of the Head, to the birth, or its Face.</head>
                  <p>
                     <label>DR.</label> Good Mrs. <hi>Eutrapelia,</hi> I do very well approve of this your anſwer to my laſt quere; now in the next place I would know of you how you would bring a Woman to bed when the Child ſhall preſent it ſelf with the ſide of its Head firſt, or its Face.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Mid.</label> When the child Sir preſents it ſelf in this poſture, as with the ſide of the head though it ſeems a natural labor, becauſe the head comes firſt, yet 'tis very dangerous both to child and mother, for the child ſhall ſooner break its neck than ever be born in this faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by how much the mothers pains con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to bear it which is impoſſible unleſs the head be firſt right plac'd, the more the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages are ſtopt up.</p>
                  <p>Therefore as ſoon as 'tis known the woman muſt be lay'd with all ſpeed, leſt the child ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing farther in this vicious poſture, it prove more difficult to thruſt it back; which
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:34775:62"/> muſt be done when we would place the head right in the paſſage as it truely and naturally ſhould be.</p>
                  <p>Now to effect this I muſt place the woman that her hips be a little higher than her head and ſhoulders, cauſing her to lean a little upon the oppoſite ſide to the childs ill poſture; then I muſt ſlide up my hand being well anointed with oil, by the ſide of the child's head, for to bring it right gently with my fingers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the head and the womb: but if the head be ſo engaged that it cannot be eaſily done that way, I muſt then put my hand up to its ſhoulders, that ſo by thruſting them back in the womb, ſometimes on the one ſide, and ſometimes on the other; as I ſee occaſion, ſo ſhall I give it a natural and convenient po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                  <p>And here it were to be wiſhed that the midwife could put back the Infant by the ſhoulders with both her hands in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but the head doth take up ſo much room that ſhe hath much ado to introduce one only with which ſhe muſt do her operation, with the half of the fingers ends of the other hand put up as far as neceſſary, afterwards let her excite and procure the childs birth, as direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before.</p>
                  <p>Then ſometimes the child comes with its face firſt, having its head turn'd back; in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:34775:62"/> which poſture it is very difficult it ſhould be born; and if it long remain ſo, the face will be ſo black and blew, and ſwell'd that at firſt ſight it will appear monſtrous, which comes as well by the compreſſion of it in that place as by the Midwives fingers handling it too rudely, when ſhe endeavor'd to place it in a better poſture.</p>
                  <p>There was a certain Woman whoſe Child came with its Face ſo black and miſhapen as ſoon as it was born, as is uſual in ſuch caſes, that it looked like a black Moor; as ſoon as the Mother ſaw it, ſhe ſaid ſhe alwaies fear'd her Child would be ſo monſtrous, becauſe when ſhe was young with Child of it ſhe fixt her looks very much upon a black moor; wherefore ſhe wiſhed or at leaſt wiſe car'd not though it dyed, rather than ſhe ſaid ſhe ſhould behold a Child ſo monſtrouſly disfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as it then appear'd; but ſhe ſoon chang'd her mind when ſhe was made ſenſible, that this blackneſs was occaſion'd only by reaſon that it came into the World with its face forwards, and that aſſuredly in three or four days it would wear away; as accordingly it happen'd; having often anointed it with oyl of ſweet Almonds, as ſhe was order'd; and when the Child came to be about a 12 month old, you could have ſcarcely ſeen a fairer. Now to deliver this birth the Midwife muſt
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:34775:63"/> obſerve the ſame manner, as in that whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>
                     <label>DR.</label> Very well Mrs. <hi>Eutrapelia,</hi> you have now given us a farther account of your very good judgment in your Art, in your dextrous &amp; ingenious way of bringing a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to bed in the laſt poſture. But now I would deſire you to let me know how you will deliver a Woman of her Child, when its head is born, but yet the Womb cloſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout its Neck.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Mid.</label> Truely Sir to deliver this Woman is not ſo eaſie abuſineſs as may be imagin'd, by reaſon that a ſmall delay herein may cauſe the ſtrangling of the Child.</p>
                  <p>And here you muſt obſerve that the Child comes naturally with the Head firſt, becauſe by its bigneſs and hardneſs the paſſage might be the better made and opened, for the other parts of the body; the which uſually paſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards without pain; but yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſometimes the Head is ſo ſmall and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34775:64"/> the ſhoulders ſo large, that without a very great difficulty they cannot paſs, which makes the Child remain often in the paſſage after the head is born. And this accident may likewiſe happen ſometimes for not having been careful to loſe no time in drawing forth the Child by the head, to the end the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders might, at the ſame inſtant, follow in the ſame place the head poſſeſt.</p>
                  <p>Now when I meet with this Figure, I muſt by all poſſible means ſeek ſpeedily to deliver the poor Child out of this priſon, or rather ſnare, or collar in which it is caught, for fear as I ſaid before, it come by delay to be ſtrangl'd: to prevent which I muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to cauſe the ſhoulders immediately to follow by gently drawing its Head, ſometimes by the ſides of it, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with one hand under the chin, and the other behind its head, and ſo doing by turns, on the one ſide and the other, to facilitate the operation the better, being very careful and circumſpect that the Navil-ſtring be not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled about its Neck; as alſo not to draw it forth with too much violence, for fear leaſt it may happen, as I once ſaw, the Head to be pulled from the Shoulders. But if the Shoulders come not with gentle pulling, then I muſt ſlide up my fingers on both ſides under the Arm-pits, with which turning them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:34775:64"/> I may by little and little, draw forth the Soulders; but if when they are in the paſſage and totally diſengaged, if I cannot get the reſt forth by ſtill keeping my fingers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Arm-pits, I may be very confident there is ſome other hindrance, and that it is certainly monſtrous in ſome part of its body; or that, as it for the moſt part happens in this caſe, it is hydropical in the belly; for which cauſe it is impoſſible it ſhould be born, before the belly be pierced to evacuate the waters; and then it will eaſily be accompliſh'd; but this being the expert Phyſitian or Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion's parts to perform, I ſhall leave it wholly to them.</p>

                  <head>SECT. XXVI. When the Navil-ſtring comes firſt.</head>
                  <p>
                     <label>DR.</label> Now Mrs. <hi>Eutrapelia,</hi> I would know of you how you behave your ſelf when you have a labor preſented to you wherein the Childs Navil-ſtring comes firſt?</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Mid.</label> Here Sir you muſt note, That an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant doth not always preſent with the belly when the navil-ſtring comes firſt; for though it preſents naturally as to the Figure of its body, that is with its Head firſt, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Navil-ſtring falls down and comes before it; for which cauſe the Child is in much danger of death, eſpecially if the labor be not very quick, becauſe the blood that ought to paſs and repaſs, through thoſe Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels which compoſe it, for to nouriſh and keep the Child alive, whilſt it continues in the Womb, being coagulated hinders the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which ought to be there made, which happens as well by the contuſion, as the cold thoſe Veſſels receive, being much preſſed in the paſſage when it comes together with the Head, or any other part; as alſo becauſe the blood doth there coagulate as is ſaid, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34775:65"/> of the cold which it takes by the coming forth of the Navil-ſtring.</p>
                  <p>But though this accident may cauſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants ſudden death, 'tis not ſo much for lack of nouriſhment; without which it may paſs a whole day or more, there being blood e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in its body for that purpoſe: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the blood can be no longer enliven'd and renewed by circulation, as it hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual need; which being obſtructed always cauſeth the creatures ſudden death, ſooner or later according as it is more or leſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed.</p>
                  <p>I know it may be objected that though the circulation be ſo hindred and intercepted by the coming forth of the ſtring it need not therefore cauſe ſuch a ſudden death to the Child, becauſe the blood may notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circulate in all the other parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: To which I anſwer that in reſpect to the Infant 'tis either abſolutely neceſſary that the blood, for want of reſpiration, ſhould be elaborated or prepared, in the thick part of the burthen call'd the <hi>placenta,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be a free communication, or for want of it that the Infant muſt immediately breathe at the mouth, as well to be refreſhed, as to drive out the fuliginous or ſooty Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors by expiration, which not being poſſible whilſt in the Womb, it muſt unavoidably be
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34775:66"/> choaked, and dye in a very ſhort time, if it wants both together.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore in this caſe the Woman muſt, without any delay, be deliver'd, the which if nature doth not ſpeedily perform, the Child muſt be drawn forth by its feet.</p>
                  <p>Women that have great waters and along ſtring to the burthen, are very ſubject to this miſchief; for the waters coming forth in great abundance at the breaking of the skins, or membranes, do often at that inſtant, draw the ſtring which ſwims in the midſt, forth along with them; and much the eaſier if the Infants head be not advanced very forward into the paſſage, for to hinder the coming forth of it in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Aſſoon as 'tis perceived you muſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately endeavor to put it back, to prevent the cooling of it, behind the Childs head, leaſt it be bruiſed, as we have already noted, whereby the blood may coagulate there keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in that place where it was thruſt back, until the head being fully come forth into the paſſage may hinder the coming down of it again; which may be effected by holding it up with the fingers of one hand, on that ſide it comes down, untill the head be advanced as aforeſaid; or in caſe the hand be taken away to put a piece of fine ſoft rag between the ſide of the head and the Womb, to ſtop up
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34775:66"/> the way it came down by, always leaving an end of the rag without the body to draw it forth by at pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>But ſometimes notwithſtanding all theſe cautions and the putting of it back, it will for all that come forth every pain; and then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more delays at all the Midwife muſt bring the Child forth by the Feet, which ſhe muſt make a diligent ſearch and enquiry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, although the Infant comes with the head foremoſt; for there is but this only means left remaining to ſave the Childs life, which it would certainly loſe by the leaſt delay in ſuch a caſe.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore having placed the Woman conveniently, let her gently put back the Head which offers, provided it be not engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too low amongſt the bones of the paſſage, and that it may be done without too great violence to the Woman; for in that caſe it will be better to let the Child run the hazard of dying, than to deſtroy the Mother; for <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as my learned Mr. <hi>Riolanus</hi> very well obſerves, upon a like Subject, ſaith <hi>That it is a neceſſary cruelty, to kill the Child in ſuch a caſe, rather then to ſave it from the danger it is in of dying, and ſo certainly cauſe the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death;</hi> and then let her ſlide up her hand, being well anointed, under the breaſt and belly to ſearch for the Feet, by which ſhe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34775:67"/> muſt draw it forth according as hath been formerly diſcourſed; the which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd let her immediately take care, of the Infant, which is ever in this caſe very fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

                  <head>SECT. XXVII. Wherein the Burthen either firſt offers it ſelf or comes first quite forth.</head>
                  <p>
                     <label>DR.</label> Very well, and excellently have you given us demonſtrations of your skill and knowledge hitherto, good Mrs. <hi>Eutrape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> now pray will you inform me how you act your part in a Labor wherein the burthen either firſt offers, or elſe comes firſt quite forth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Mid.</label> That I ſhall Sir to the beſt of my Talent and therefore firſt of all Sir I muſt note that the coming forth of the Navil-ſtring before the Infant, whereof we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed in our foregoing Section, is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the cauſe of its death, for the reaſon there alleadged; but the coming forth of the burthen firſt, is yet much more dangerous; for that beſides that the Children are then commonly Stil-born, if they be not aſſiſted in the very inſtant, the Mother likewiſe is in great peril of her life alſo, becauſe of her great floodings, which uſually happen, when it is looſened from the Womb before its due
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:34775:68"/> time; by reaſon that it leaves all the orifices of the Veſſels, to which it did cleave, open, whence inceſſantly flows blood until the Child be born; by reaſon that the Womb, as long as any thing continues there, doth every moment ſtrongly endeavour to expell it, by which means it continually voids and expreſſeth the blood of the Veſſels, which are alwaies open (as we have already explained) when the burthen is ſo ſeparated; as long as the Womb remains extended and cannot be cloſed, until it hath voided all that it did contain, and comes, by the contraction of its Membranous ſubſtance, to ſtop them by preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them together; wherefore if the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife ought to be vigilent and diligent to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour an Infant when the Navil-ſtring comes firſt, how much more ought ſhe to be ſo when burthen comes forth firſt, and wherein the leaſt delay is ever the cauſe of the Infants ſudden death, if the Woman be not ſpeedily delivered? becauſe the Infant cannot then remain long in the Womb without being choaked or ſtifled, being it ſtands in need at that time of breathing at the mouth, (as we explain'd the foregoing diſcourſe,) the blood being no longer enlivened by the preparation made in the burthen, the uſe and function of which then ceaſing, from that very inſtant that it is ſeparated from the Veſſels of the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:34775:68"/> Womb, to which it was joined; for which reaſon there immediately follows a great fludding which is ſo dangerous for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that without ſpeedy help, ſhe quickly looſeth her life by this unlucky accident.</p>
                  <p>Now when the Burthen is not wholly come forth but lies in the paſſage, ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe to put it back before the Child be fetch'd; but I am not of their opinion; for when it comes into the paſſage before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant; it is at that time totally divided from the Womb, at the bottom whereof it ought to be commonly ſituated and faſtened, until the Child be born: but becauſe as ſoon as it is wholly looſened, as it always is when it comes firſt, it becomes a body altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural; therefore it is never to be thruſt back, but contrarywiſe be fetch'd away, and at that very moment after bring the Child away by the Feet, although it came naturally with the Head firſt: for what reaſon can there be to put it back, ſince it is of no uſe to the Infant, from the moment it is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Womb, as cannot be denied? And ſuch a proceeding is ſo far from being uſeful, that this burthen would much hinder the Midwife from being able to turn the Child, as ſhe ought, in bringing it forth by the Feet.</p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:34775:69"/>
                  <p>Wherefore when it preſents it ſelf in the paſſage, which may ſoon be perceived if the Midwife find every where a ſoft ſubſtance, without the leaſt reſiſtance of any ſolid part to the touch; and finding likewiſe the ſtring faſtned to the middle of it, and the Woman fludding extreamly as is ordinary at ſuch times; then in lieu of thruſting it back, the burthen muſt be brought away, that ſo there may be the more liberty and room to draw forth the Child, according as hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore directed.</p>
                  <p>The Burthen then being quite looſened from the womb, and coming firſt in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage muſt not be thruſt back again into it, much leſs muſt it be put back when it is quite come forth of the body. The midwife muſt only take care not to cut the ſtring till the child be born, not out of hopes of any benefit from it to the Infant during the delivery, but that ſo much time may not be loſt before the Infant be fetch away, which is then ever in great danger, as alſo the flooding may be the ſooner ſtopt, which happens. for the moſt part as ſoon as the woman is delivered, for which reaſons it will be diſpatched with all poſſible ſpeed.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes notwithſtanding this dangerous accident the child may be born alive, if timely ſuccoured, but it is then ſo weak that it is
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:34775:69"/> hard to diſcover at firſt, whether it be alive or dead.</p>
                  <p>When it ſo happens ſome midwies do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, before they ſeperate the burthen, put it into a Skillet of hot wine, and imagine, with no ſmall ſuperſtition, that in caſe it it comes to it ſelf, the vapours of the warm wine was the cauſe of it, being conveyed by means of the ſtring into the Infants belly, and ſo giving vigor; but it is more credible that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt ſtifled for want of breathing as it needed it, it begins now, by means of it, to recover from that fainting: but nevertheleſs there may be no hurt in continuing the old cuſtom, ſince it can do no perjudice, and may ſatisfie fine occupied Spirits, provided neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries be not neglected, in being blindly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with this conceit.</p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:34775:74"/> they are to be turned or thruſt back to the end that ſhe may give them a better poſition then that wherein they preſent.</p>
                  <p>Where note then, that when a Woman hath 2 Children they do not ordinarily both preſent to the birth together, but one is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes more forward then the other, which is the cauſe why but one is felt, and that 'tis ſometimes not diſcovered that the Woman will have Twins, till going to fetch the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, the firſt being born, the 2 d is then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                  <p>When there are Twins Mrs. <hi>Eutrapelia</hi> one muſt not think that Nature is orderly in cauſing one to be born before the other, the firſt or laſt, according as it may be moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, that is to ſay when the one is ſtrong and the other weak, that the ſtrongeſt comes firſt; as alſo when one is dead and the other living, that the living one drives forth the dead one: for I can aſſure you there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or infallible rule in theſe caſes; of which I can give you an example; there were once 2 women deliver'd within a week of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and both of Twins, the one of each be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead and the other living, the living Child of the firſt Woman was born before the dead one, and the dead one the 2d was expelled before the living one. And the ſame thing we ſee happens very often in reſpect of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:34775:74"/> ſtrong and weak Children; for that which is neareſt the birth whether alive or dead, ſtrong or weak, is always the firſt born, or muſt be brought into the World the firſt, if it cannot come of it ſelf; otherwiſe the difficulty of the Labor would yet be augmented as well in length of time to the Mother, as the violence done to the firſt Child, in putting it back, for to fetch the 2d firſt.</p>
                  <p>Now the Midwife muſt always remember to have a care in all natural births, to examine diligently whether there be no more Children in the Womb after the firſt is delivered, which ſhe may eaſily know by the continuance of the pains after the Child is born, and the bigneſs of the Mothers belly; beſides this ſhe may be very ſure of it, if ſhe ſhall put her hand up the entry of the Womb, and ſhall there find another water a gathering, and a Child in it preſenting to the paſſage; and if this ſhall be ſo, the Midwife is not to fetch away the after-birth till the Woman be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of all her Children, if ſhe chance to have never ſo many, becauſe Twins never have but one burthen, to which there are faſtened as many ſtrings and diſtinct Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes as there are Children, and if one ſhould go to draw it forth as ſoon as the Birth is born, the reſt would be in danger of their lives, becauſe that part is very neceſſary to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:34775:75"/> them whileſt they are in the Womb, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides more then that it endangers a flooding. Wherefore the firſt ſtring muſt be cut, being firſt tyed with three or four double, and the other end muſt be faſtened, with a ſtring to the Womans thigh; not ſo much for fear that the ſtring ſhould enter again into the Womb, as to prevent the inconvenience it may cauſe to the Woman by hanging be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her thighs; afterwards this Child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed, the Midwife muſt take care to deliver her of the reſt, obſerving all the ſame circumſtances as were belonging to the firſt, the which being done it will be then conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and neceſſary to fetch away the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth; as we ſhall diſcourſe the manner how by and by.</p>

                     <label>Mid.</label> Worthy Dr. This caſe is the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of any that hitherto you have propounded to me; and though it may never fall out to be ſo in one amongnſt 5000, yet (becauſe, in your deſcription of the beſt Midwife, you tell me that a Midwife muſt have a good memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) I remember a learned Doctor, not long ſince acquainted me with ſuch a poſture, which he told he had from the hands of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Chirurgeon and Phyſitian, whoſe wife
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:34775:76"/> alſo was an expert Midwife; and the courſe the Midwifed took in ſuch a caſe, he told me was this, which muſt ſerve alſo for my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, becauſe I think there cannot be a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. After the woman had been eight daies in labour, and given over by all Midwives as deſperate, being in a violent Fever., with no throws, but very weak, and (by reaſon of hot medicines given to expel the birth, and ſtrong wines given to ſupport the ſpirits) thoſe humors, that uſually accompany the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant had ſo flown out, that the genitals were ſo dry and cloſed, that they would ſcarce ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the probation of two fingers. This me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod was uſed: Firſt, inſtead of wine, ſhe gave her good ſtore of Almond-milk; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her belly was very coſtive, ſhe gave her Clyſters; and to keep up her ſpirits ſhe gave her Cordials, (of which in their order.) She laid plaiſters to her hands wriſts, and anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the whole region of the belly, hips, loins, the rump-bone, and privities with Oyles to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe her pain and with ſoftning Unguents; and then ſhe made a triangular bagg ſtuff'd with emollient and relaxing herbs, boyled in water, according to this deſcription, (and of which more hereafter.)</p>

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:34775:77"/> the precedent throws and pangs. But at length, when with much labour and induſtry the genitals were ſomewhat dilated, that ſhe could get in her fingers farther, ſhe found the loyns and the right hand of the child firſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it ſelf to the birth: that therefore ſhe might correct this monſtrous and ſo inverted poſture of the Infant ſo doubled and twiſted, and either perſwade the head or the feet to come forward, ſhe uſed the beſt of her skill, but to little purpoſe, the genitals were ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ſtreight. But yet not giving off her endeavours, ſhe did deliver her within eight hours after ſhe came to her aſſiſtance; but the child was dead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Dr.</label> Mrs. You give a very good account of an expert Midwives practice, which you may follow with ſafety, expecting the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs from Heaven; but it is no wonder the child ſhould be ſtill-born, (as you phraſe it;) for being ſo turned and doubled, the child muſt of neceſſity be ſtrangled in the womb.</p>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:34775:78"/> as you have heard before, is bent and tumbled ſeveral waies; inſomuch, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is ſtrangely entangled with its own navil-cord, which I am confident you have ſeen in your own experience oftentimes, and ſhall now in the next place deſire you to let me know which way you uſe to go to work, when a dead Child is to be delivered from its Mother and ſhe alive.</p>

                  <p>
                     <label>MId.</label> Sir I ſhall moſt willingly conſent to your demand, as far as I ſhall be able, in this always ſo long and dangerous a Labor; which is becauſe for the moſt part it comes wrong; or though it comes right with the Head, yet the Womans pains are ſo weak and ſlow in theſe caſes that ſhe cannot bring it forth, and ſometimes ſhe hath none at all, foraſmuch as nature, half overthrown by the death of the Child, which cannot help it ſelf, labors ſo little, that many times it cannot fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the buſineſs it hath begun, but muſt yeild, without the help of art, of which at ſuch a time it hath great need: However before ever I may ſettle to your work, I'll endeavor to ſtir up the Womans pains with ſtrong and ſharp clyſters, to bring on her throws, and to bear down and bring forth the Child; and if theſe means prevail not ſhe muſt then be delivered by the help of art.</p>
                  <p>Now if there be any caſe wherein a Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife ought to make the greateſt reflection and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:34775:79"/> uſe moſt precaution in her Art it is this, that is to know whether the Infant in the Womb be living or dead; for there have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deplorable examples of Childrens being drawn forth alive, after they have been thought to have been dead, with both Arms or ſome other limb lopt off, and others miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably kill'd by the uſe of crotchets which might have been born alive if they had not been miſtaken: wherefore before the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife reſolves on the manner of laying the Woman, to avoid the like misfortune, and the diſgrace of being author of ſuch a pitiful ſpectacle let her do her utmoſt endeavour not to be ſo deceiv'd and to be wholly ſatisfied whether the Child be alive or dead; always remembring in this caſe that timidity is more pardonable then temerity, that is, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be deceived in treating a dead Infant, as if in caſe it were a live, then a living one as if it were dead.</p>
                  <p>Now beſides what hath been ſaid before concerning knowing whether the Child be alive or not; you muſt not always put your whole confidence, in the firſt place, in the Womans telling you that the Child is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly alive becauſe it ſtirs, and though to be the better aſſur'd the Midwife may lay her hand on the Mothers belly, for there have been Women ſometimes delivered whoſe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:34775:79"/> Children had been dead about 4 days, as might be eaſily judged by their corruption, who notwithſtanding have affirmed, though untruly, that they felt them ſtir but a little before they were delivered; and others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain whoſe Children were alive, and yet their Mothers never perceived them to ſtir in three or 4 days before, as they confeſſed:</p>
                  <p>Now if the Midwife cannot be aſſured by the Childs motion that it is alive, ſhe may aſſoon as the waters are broke, gently put up her hand into the Womb, to feel for the breaking of the Navil-ſtring, the which ſhe will find to be ſtronger, the nearer ſhe feels it to the Infants belly; or if ſhe meets with in hand ſhe may feel the pulſe; but their pulſes, you muſt know are not ſo ſtrong as their Navil-ſtrings, therefore the beſt to be known by it; if then alſo by putting her fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into the Childs mouth ſhe perceive it to ſtir its Tongue, as if it would ſuck; and on the contrary, if no ſuch ſigns, and the Mother feel a great weight, and great pains in her belly, and it be not ſupported but tumbles always on the ſide ſhe lays her ſelf; if ſhe faints and have Convulſion Fits, if the Navil-ſtring or ſecondine hath been a good while in the World, and if the Midwife by putting her hand into the Womb, finds the Child cold, and feeling ſhe finds that very ſoft,

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that we ſpake of before, that is, in drawing forth the Child, to keep its breaſt and face always downwards; And if notwithſtanding all theſe precautions, the head, becauſe of the great putrefaction, ſhould be ſeparated and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:34775:80"/> left behind in the Womb; it muſt be left to be drawn forth by the expert Phyſitian or Chyrurgion. The ſame alſo is to be ſaid when the Head is ſo far advanced coming firſt, and engaged among the bones of the paſſage, that it cannot be put back, then being very ſure by all the ſigns together or moſt of the chief of them, that the Child is dead cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, 'tis better to let the Surgeon draw it ſo forth, it being a round ſlippery part, with crotchets, then torment the Woman to put it back. Now if the dead Child (whereof above all there muſt be good aſſurance,) comes with its arms up to it ſhoulders ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſwelled that the Woman muſt ſuffer too much violence to have it put back, 'tis beſt then, as was ſaid before, to take it off at the ſhoulder joint, by twiſting it 3 or 4 times about; then afterwards the Midwife will have more room to put up her hand into the Womb, the arm being ſo ſeparated and no longer poſſeſſing the Womb, and ſo fetch away the Child by the Feet.</p>
                  <p>For indeed although it be certain that the Child be quite dead in the Womb, and other circumſtances that will demonſtrate that there is need of a Phyſitian or Surgeons Art, yet he muſt not therefore preſently uſe his crotchets; becauſe they are never to be uſed but when hands are not ſufficient, and that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:34775:81"/> there is no other remedy to prevent the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans danger, or to bring away the Child any other way: for very often, though all hath been done that art directs, ſome perſons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that underſtand not theſe things will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Child was kill'd with the crot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches although it had been dead 3 days before, and without other reaſonings and better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the matter for his recompence, in ſaving the life of the Mother, requite him, with an accuſation of which he is altogether innocent, and in caſe the Mother ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards dye, by misfortune, lay her death alſo to his charge, and inſtead of praiſe and thanks treat him like a Butcher, or Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; to which divers Midwifes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly very ready to contribute, and are the firſt that make the poor Women, that have need of the Men, afraid of them. Inſomuch that they are afraid of being blamed by them for having themſelves been the cauſe, (as ſome of them often are) of the death of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and many ill accidents which often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall the poor Women, for not cauſing them to be helped in due time, and from the very inſtant that they perceive the difficulty of the labor to paſs their underſtandings. I ſpeak this by way of caution on both ſides.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore for the Phyſitian or Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion to avoid theſe calumnies, let him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:34775:81"/> uſe his crotchets, but very rarely when there is no other way; as alſo to endeavor his utmoſt, as much as the caſe will permit, to bring the Child whole into the World al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be dead, and not by bits and peice-meals, to give the ignorant not any pretence of blame; I ſay as much as the caſe will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that is, with reſpect to the Woman un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hands; for to ſave her he had better ſometimes to bring forth the Child with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, then to kill her, by tormenting her with exceſſive violence to bring it forth whole: for in a word, he muſt and ought to do, in his conſcience, what his Art commands, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking heed to what may be ſpoken after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: and every Phyſitian or Chirurgion that hath a well regulated conſcience, will always have a greater regard to his duty, then his reputation, in ſuch a caſe; in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of which let him expect his reward from God.</p>

                     <label>DR.</label> We have hitherto Mrs. <hi>Eutrapelia</hi> diſcourſed of births natural and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural; there is ſomewhat more, not like theſe, but often with them, and without them, which Phyſitians call a <hi>Mola,</hi> but you call it a falſe Conception: I pray, Mrs. therefore, what is that <hi>Mola,</hi> or falſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception?</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Mid.</label> A <hi>Mola,</hi> Sir is a hard, inform tumor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of pores, (like ſo many ugly eyes) ſcarce to be cut by a knife, of a ſtony ſubſtance to touch, and round, appearing ſometimes at the entrance of the Womb, ſometimes over the whole Womb, and is thought (by very Learned Doctors) to be begotten by the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man her ſelf without the help of a man, (though ſome affirm it cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſeed of the man.) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inanimate, becauſe not generated by
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:34775:82"/> two; without the help of a man (I ſay) by the force of her own ſeed, mixing it ſelf with much menſtruous blood, reteined in the Womb, which by immoderate heat is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the ſhape of fleſh, and that altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unnatural, as is the ſtone in the bladder, and in the fingers of gouty perſons, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Dr.</label> Well, Mrs, ſince 'tis ſo (tell me, I pray, wherein it differs from a true Conception?</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Mid.</label> It may, Sir, be like a true Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in three reſpects, yet differ in ſix. As firſt, 'Tis true that a falſe conception ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the monthly terms as doth the true.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The belly alſo doth ſwell, and the breaſts grow big.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is an alteration both in the color and appetite; but yet they differ in theſe ſix following ways; as,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A falſe conception hath no ordinary nor periodical motion, neither doth it ſtir from ſide to ſide, except it be preſſed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In a falſe conception the belly is harder, and the feet are much more ſwelled.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The woman is more heavy and unweeldy, and not ſo nimble as with a true conception.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The breaſts ſwell not ſo much as in a true conception.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The whole body grows ſoft, and conſumes away in a falſe conception.</p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:34775:83"/>
                  <p>Sixthly, a falſe conception may be moved in three months, but the Child ſtirreth not till after three months, or uſually in the fourth month: And again, the birth of an Infant never exceeds the eleventh month, whereas a falſe conception may continue for fourteen years, or as long as they live.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, there may be a Tympany cauſed by air included in the Womb. Or elſe there may be a Dropſie, by reaſon of the many hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors contained in the Womb, both which may give a falſe ſuppoſition of being with Child; but theſe alſo are eaſily diſtinguiſh'd from a falſe conception. A Tympany may be moved from place to place, but not the other: A Tympany will ſound, if lightly ſtrucken, but not the other: and a Dropſie, cauſed by thoſe many humors as aforeſaid, will ſhew ſome marks, being depreſſed with the fingers, whereas a <hi>Mola</hi> is hard, and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to the pulſation or depreſſion of the fingers. And laſtly, in both theſe moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the Thighs ſwell, but in a falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception or <hi>Mola</hi> the Thighs wither, and are leſſer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Dr.</label> Thus far have you extreamly inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly, Mrs. <hi>Eutrapelia</hi> expreſt your ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a <hi>Mola;</hi> and now you have done, I pray you give me leave to lay you down my ſentiments concerning both a <hi>Mola,</hi> and a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:34775:83"/> falſe conception and the ſafeſt and beſt way to draw them forth of the Womb with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all then Mrs. you muſt know that there are ſeveral ſorts of great bellies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Women, as hath been ſaid before; there are your natural big bellies which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a living Child, and thoſe may be called true ones, and others unnatural, or againſt nature, in which, in lieu of a Child, is engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred nothing but ſtrange matters, as wind mixed with waters, which may be called drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of the Womb, and falſe conceptions, and Moles or Membranes full of blood and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſeed; for which reaſon they are called falſe great bellies.</p>
                  <p>Now you muſt know that among the ſigns of a true great belly, one is the ſtirring of the Child in the Womb; but here you are to obſerve that it is very fit we ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways careful not to be deceived, by what we feel to ſtir in the Womb; inaſmuch as the Infant of it ſelf, is endued with 2 ſorts of motions in its Mothers Womb, that is to ſay, a total motion, and a partial motion; the total motion is when it removes the whole body, and that is when it moves only but one part at a time, as the Head, Arms, or Legs, all the reſt of its body lying unmoved; now the Womb blown up in fits of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:34775:84"/> yea and ſome moles have, by accident, a kind of total motion, but never a partial one; for that motion of a mole is rather a falling down then otherwiſe, to wit, a motion by which heavy things do uſe to fall downwards: for a Woman who hath a mole of any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable bigneſs, whatſoever ſide ſhe turns her ſelf to, her belly will fall the very ſelf ſame way immediately, even like unto an heavy bowl.</p>
                  <p>Then again you may remember that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſign of a great belly, was the ſtopping of the courſes, and withal a little qualmiſhneſs, which is not always true, and women who daily uſe copulation are very often ſubject to be deceived hereby thinking that then they are with child, whenas indeed falſe concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall cauſe you almoſt the ſame accidents as true ones, the which cannot eaſily be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed but by its conſequences.</p>
                  <p>For this falſe great belly is often cauſed by wind, which blows up and ſtretcheth out the womb, like a bladder, the which women often diſcharge with as much noiſe as if it came from the fundament; and ſometimes tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but water which is gath'red there in ſuch abundance, as ſome women have been known to void a pail-ful without any child, though they veryly believed they had been with child; Now your moles always proceed
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:34775:84"/> from ſome falſe conceptions which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the womb grow there by the blood that flows to them and by the accumulation of which they are by little and little encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and if the womb chance to expell it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 2 months, it may be called a falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; and ſome of them are only but as it were the ſeed involv'd in a membrane, the others are alittle more ſolid and fleſhy; reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, in ſome ſort, the Gizard of a foul, and are greater or leſs according to the time they remain in the womb, and alſo according to the quantity of blood with which they are always ſoaked: and women expell theſe falſe conceptions ſooner or later according as they cleave to the womb, the which makes them almoſt always to flood in great quantity at thoſe times, but for your moles they often continue in the womb after the ordinary time of labor; ſome women having had them a whole year, yea many years, as happened to a certain Peuterors wife, of whom the great Chirurgion <hi>Ambroſe Parry</hi> makes makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his book of generation, who had a mole 17 years, and at laſt dyed of it; for if they keep it ſo long they go in danger of their lives; for their long or ſhort continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is according as they are more or leſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to the inward parts of the womb, and are there entertained and nouriſhed by the blood that flows thither.</p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:34775:85"/>
                  <p>And here I pray you note that it is of great importance to diſtinquiſh well betwixt a true and a falſe great belly; for the faults com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by a miſtake are always very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: foraſmuch as in a true great belly the child ought to continue in the womb till na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture endeavors to expell it by a natural la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, but contrarily the falſe great belly dict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates to us to procure the expulſion of what it conteins as ſoon as may be, wherefore we ought to be very careful. And if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occaſions wherein the Phyſitians and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions and Midwives ought to be more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and to make more reflections upon their prognoſtics for an affair of ſo great an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as this is, it is in this which concerns their judgments as to conceptions and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens being with child; to the intent that they may avoid the great accidents and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, which they may cauſe which are too precipitate in it without a certain knowledge. Now the faults which are and may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted at ſuch a time through too much fear, are in ſome ſort excuſable and to be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but not thoſe cauſed by raſhneſs which are incomparably greater.</p>
                  <p>And now to return to my diſcourſe of moles, I take a mole to be nothing elce but a fleſhy ſubſtance, without bones, or joynts, or diſtinction of members; without form or
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:34775:85"/> figure, regulated and determined; engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred againſt nature in the womb, after copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, out of the corrupted ſeed both of the man and the woman; notwithſtanding there are ſome ſometimes which have ſome linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens of a rought form.</p>
                  <p>And here I take it to be very certain that a woman never engenders a mole with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the uſe of copulation, both ſeeds being required to it, as well as for a true generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though it may be otherways imagined, as you ſaid, by very learned Drs. for truely though there may be ſome women, who though never having carnally had to do with any man, yet do naturally caſt forth ſome ſtrange bodies, after a flooding, which in a appearance ſeems to be fleſh; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding if you ſhall take more diligent and ſpecial notice thereof, you will find it to prove to be but ſome clods of blood coagulated, either without conſiſtance or fleſhy texture, or any ways membranous, as are your moles and falſe conceptions; and that ſtony hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was cauſed through its long ſtay in the womb being there baked as in an hot oven.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the manner of the engendring of moles I take it to be ordinarily this, that it is when either the mans or the womans ſeed or both together are weak or corrupted, the womb not laboring for a true conception, but
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:34775:86"/> by the help of the ſpirits with which the ſeed ought to be repleniſhed; but ſo much the eaſier as that ſmall quantity found in it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, and as it were choaked, and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an abundance of the groſs and corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed menſtruous blood, which ſometimes flows thither, ſoon after conception, and gives not leiſure to nature to perfect, what ſhe hath, with great pains, begun; and ſo troubling its work, bringing thither confuſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, there is made of the ſeeds and blood; a mere <hi>Chaos,</hi> called a <hi>Mole,</hi> not uſually engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred but in the Womb of a Woman, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or very rarely found in that of other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, by reaſon that they have no menſtruous blood as a woman that divine creature hath.</p>
                  <p>A mole, moreover you are to note, hath no burthen, nor navil-ſtring faſtned to it, as a childs always hath, for as much as the mole it ſelf ſticks cloſe to the womb, by which means it receives nouriſhment from its veſſels, it is alſo likewiſe uſually clothed with a kind of skin, in which is formed a piece of fleſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly interlaced with many Veſſels; it is of a bigneſs and conſiſtence more or leſs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the abundance of blood it receives, and according to its diſpoſition, and alſo accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the temperature of the Womb, and the time it remains there. For the moſt part there is but one, yet ſometimes there are more,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:34775:86"/> whereof ſome cleave very ſtrongly to the Womb, others very ſlightly: if women miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry of them before the 2d Month, as I ſaid before, they are call'd falſe Conceptions; and when they keep them longer, and that this ſtrange body begins to grow bigger, then they are called Moles: and here you muſt know that your falſe Conceptions are more Membranous, and ſometimes full of corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Seed, but your Moles are altogether fleſhy; they cleave to the Womb almoſt always, and are ſuſtained by the blood, with which it is always furniſhed, juſt as plants are by the moiſture of the Earth. Sometimes there is a Child together with a Mole, from which it is ſometimes divided and ſometimes cleaving to its body, which puts it in great danger of being Monſtrous or miſhaken, becauſe of the Compreſſion which this ſtrange body cauſeth to the little Infant, as yet being but very tender.</p>
                  <p>Thus having at large given you my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning Moles and falſe Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, their cauſes ſigns and differences; there remains now nothing more concerning this matter, to be demonſtrated, but the manner how they ought to be drawn forth of the Womb.</p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:34775:87"/>
                  <p>And now ſeeing that theſe things contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Womb, are wholly unnatural, their expulſion muſt be procured as ſoon as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble may be, the which is very difficult to be performed, when theſe ſtrange Bodies cleave ſo faſt to the Womb, and eſpecially the Mole; therefore to avoid the abundance of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and inconveniences, as near as may be, that theſe unnatural things will produce, they muſt be endeavoured to be expell'd as ſoon as may be; and for the <hi>Mola</hi> you muſt, before you come to the Manual Operation, try if by any means you can to cauſe the Woman to expel it of her ſelf; to the which purpoſe you are to adminiſter to her ſtrong and ſharp cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to ſtir up throws, for to open the Womb to give way to it; moiſtning alſo and looſening the Womb, with ſoftening Oyntments, Oyls and Greaſe, not omitting bleeding in the foot, if there be occaſion: Now the Mole will certainly be excluded by theſe means, provided it be but of an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent bigneſs, or that it cleave but very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or not at all to the Womb; but if it ſhal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:34775:87"/> a dead Child, then ſlide up your hand into the Womb, and therewith draw forth the Mole; but if it be ſo big that it cannot be brought forth whole, then 'tis wholly the man's work; who for this purpoſe uſe your crotchet or knife, but this is very rare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is of a tender ſoft ſubſtance, much more plyable then a Child's; but if you find it be only joyned to the Womb, and cloſe faſten'd, you muſt ſeparate it gently with your fingers ends, your Nails being paired, by putting them by little and little, between the Mole and the Womb, beginning on that ſide where it doth not ſtick ſo faſt to the Womb, and ſo purſuing it until it be quite looſened; being mighty careful, if you find it grow to too faſt, of rending or burſting the proper ſubſtance of the Womb, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding as hereafter I ſhall ſpeak of for the extraction of a Burthen ſtaying behind in the Womb when the ſtring is broken off.</p>
                  <p>For theſe ſame Moles never have any ſtring faſtened to them, nor any burthen from whence they ſhould receive their nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but they do of themſelves immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly draw their nouriſhment from the Veſſels of the Womb, to which they are almoſt all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways joined and ſticking in ſome place: and as for the ſubſtance of their fleſh, 'tis alſo
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:34775:88"/> much more hard then that of the burthen; and ſometimes <hi>Schyrrhous,</hi> which is the cauſe why it is difficult to be ſeparated from the Womb.</p>
                  <p>As to a falſe Conception, although it be much leſs then a Mole yet it often puts a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in hazard of her Life, by reaſon of great fluddings, which very often happens, when the Womb would diſcharge it ſelf of it, and endeavours to expel it, the which ſeldom ceaſe till it be come away, becauſe it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually endeavour to exclude it, whereby the blood is excited to flow away, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſqueeſed out of the open Veſſels.</p>
                  <p>Now the ſafeſt and beſt way and remedy for a Woman in this caſe is to fetch away the falſe Conception, as ſoon as may be, becauſe the Womb can very hardly avoid it of its own nature without artificial help; for it being very ſmall, the Womans impulſe in bearing downwards cannot be ſo effectual when the Womb is but little diſtended by ſo ſmall a body, as when it contains a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable bulk in it, for then it is the more ſtrongly compreſſed with the throws. Many times 'tis very difficult to fetch away theſe falſe Conceptions becauſe the Womb doth not open and dilate it ſelf, ordinarily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:34775:88"/> the proportion of what it contains, and that being but very little ſo is its opening; which is the reaſon why the Midwife is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo far from introducing her whole hand, that ſhe can ſcarce get in a few Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, with which ſhe will be obliged to finiſh the Operation, as well as ſhe may or can, by proceeding in the following manner, when ſhe hath introduced them.</p>
                  <p>Having then very well anointed her hand, ſhe muſt ſlide up the neck of the Womb into the inward Orifice, the which ſhe will find ſometimes to be but very little dilated, and then very gently put in one of her Fingers, the which ſhe muſt preſently turn and bend on every ſide, until that ſhe hath made way for a ſecond, and afterwards for a 3d or more if it may be done without violence; but many times ſhe hath enough to get in but 2, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which ſhe muſt take hold of the falſe Conception (as Crabs do with their claws, when they faſten upon any thing) and then ſhe muſt gently draw it forth, as alſo the clodded blood which ſhe there ſhall find; and then afterwards undoubtledly the fludding will ceaſe, if no part of the Conception be left behind: but if the inward Orifice cannot be more dilated then to admit of one Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and that the fludding is ſo violent as to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:34775:89"/> endanger the Womans life; then is matter and manner to be wholly committed to care and artful induſtry of the skilful Phyſitian or Chirurgeon.</p>

                     <label>Dr.</label> You ſee, Mrs. theſe Figures, with their uſes and explanation; I ſhall now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe more particularly of the membranes themſelves. The after-burden, commonly called the <hi>ſecundine,</hi> is ſo named, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is as it were a ſecond place, manſion,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:34775:92"/> and receptacle of the Infant from the Womb; or elſe, becauſe this Membrane is called the after-birth, or ſecond birth, as coming forth after the Infant, which, if it ſtay behind, brings great miſchief, as ſhall be ſpoken to at the latter end of this Treatiſe and Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>The firſt membrane is called <hi>Amnios,</hi> and this membrane covers the Infant from the head to foot; inſomuch, that part of it ſticks to the head of the Infant when it is born, which they call a helmet, though not always, being left behind with the <hi>ſecundine</hi> in diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult labours: this is ſo called from its ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and thinneſs; others reſemble it to white Paper, or a ſhirt, and is the thinneſt of all, in which is found great plenty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, cauſed of urine and ſweat, in which the Infant ſwimeth as in a bath, and lyeth ſo eaſie and ſecure, leſt it ſhould fall foul againſt thoſe neighbouring parts that are harder; and beſides that, when the membrane is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the birth, this water breaking out, may make the paſſages by the neck of the Womb more plain and ſlippery for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant; and this membrane alſo is every where included within the ſecond, which is called <hi>Chorion,</hi> becauſe it wraps the Infant like a ring; and this immediately compaſſeth the former, to which it is joyned as it were in a
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:34775:92"/> round figure, like to a cake, whoſe inward and hollow part it covers and involves, and doth extend it ſelf to its dimenſions, and can ſcarce be ſeparated from it, but doth firmly knit and bear up the veſſels of the afterbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, which immediately ſticks to the womb by a certain fleſhy maſs that is formed, being round, and of ſomewhat a ruddy colour, not compaſſing the whole infant, by reaſon of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerous ſprings of veins and atteries by which the blood is interwoven, as if it were poured in, and by which the infant is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed. This towards the infant is ſmooth, but that part which is towards that fleſhy round maſs, is rougher.</p>
                  <p>This round fleſhy ſubſtance is called the liver of the womb, or the cake of the womb; which, having ſuch a ſubſtance as the liver hath, no wonder if it ſhould make and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare blood for the nouriſhment of the infant. On that ſide towards the womb it is rough, and unequal, like clefts in a bak'd cake; and being cut in this part, it ſheweth an infinite company of hairs, which, if you trace, they will bring you to the orifice of the veins themſelves. And, although there be twins, or more, yet there is but one cake; for into one cake ſo many navil ſtrings are inſerted (in divers places) as there are young ones; though it may differ as to the bigneſs, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:34775:93"/> to the body and condition of the infant, yet the ground is ſtill the ſame in the diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This ſerves as a ſupport of the umbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal veſſels, like a pillar; it is alſo called the ſecundine. The third is called <hi>Allantoides;</hi> 'tis a coat betwixt the <hi>Chorion</hi> and <hi>Amnios;</hi> 'tis very thin, weak, and narrow; it covers but half the young one: this is properly like a ſwathe or girdle; and ſome ſay it is the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of urine; but it being not to be found in mankind (there may be an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachus</hi> found inſtead of it) I ſay no more of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Dr.</label> Theſe are the opinions of Phyſitians, good Mrs. <hi>Eutrapelia</hi> that have written of theſe things; now if you pleaſe I will tell you candidly and freely what my opinion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe things.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the 2 ſeeds have been confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mixt and retained by conception, the Womb immediately after, by means of its heat, ſeparates this <hi>Chaos,</hi> to make out there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the delineation and formation of all the parts, and begins to work upon theſe Seeds, which though to the ſight they may appear of a like nature and uniforme, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in effect they contain many diſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar parts in them, which it ſeparates and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth one from another, incloſing the nobleſt, and on the outſide the moſt glutinous, of which firſt are formed the Membranes, to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:34775:93"/> hinder the Spirits, wherewith the frothy Seeds abound, from being at that time diſſipated, and afterwards to ſerve to contain the Infant and the waters therein, in the midſt whereof it ſwims that they may not ſtream away.</p>
                  <p>Now as the Membranes of the Infant are the firſt part formed, ſo are they with the waters, the firſt that preſent themſelves to the paſſage in time of labour, before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants head.</p>
                  <p>Concerning theſe Membranes and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions moſt Authors have made of them, I find them to be ſo dark therein that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks 'tis an hard matter to conceive them, as they are, by the explication they make of them: for in the firſt place they do not agree in the number of them, ſome accounting 3, as well for a Child as a Beaſt, to wit the <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> the <hi>Amnios</hi> and the <hi>Alantoides;</hi> Others accounting but 2, becauſe there is no <hi>Alan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toides</hi> in an humane <hi>fetus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if this matter ſhall be ſtrictly examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as hath been often done, there will never be found any more then 2, the which being ſo cloſely joyned the one to the other, they may be ſaid to be but a double one, the which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed may be divided and ſeparated into 2, and this I will explain, to you and others, on ſuch a manner, as may be beſt underſtood by ſuch as are ignorant of this matter; For
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:34775:94"/> there are many who think with <hi>Galen</hi> that theſe Membranes are ſeparate and diſtant, the one from the other, and that the one ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds only the Infant, and the other receives the waters, the which are partly engendred from ſweat, and partly from the Urine, as they imagine; and believe farther that theſe waters themſelves are ſeparated the one from the other, by theſe Membranes: the which is quite contrary, for they are joyned ſo cloſe the one to the other, that they compoſe as it were but the ſame body and invelloper, the which ſerves as we have ſaid, to contain the Infant with the waters, which are all of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſhut up in the Membranes, as I ſhall make appear in ſpeaking of their original; but it matters not as to the truth after what manner this be explained, provided it may be underſtood as it is.</p>
                  <p>The outward part then of this Membrane or double covering, or involver, call it what you pleaſe, or if it be eſteemed 2, the firſt Membrane preſented without, is called <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> from the Greek word <hi>Chorein,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to contain, becauſe it immediately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virons the other, which is called <hi>Amnios,</hi> that is a little lamb, becauſe 'tis to ſmall and thin. <hi>Galen,</hi> in his 11th book of the uſe of the parts, calls the Burthen <hi>Chorion.</hi> But to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this more intelligible we ſhall take this
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:34775:94"/> firſt Membrane for the <hi>Chorion,</hi> the which may again be ſeparated into 2; though ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectively it be but one. This <hi>Chorion</hi> is a little rough and unequal throughout the whole outſide of it, in which many ſmall captillary Veſſels may be obſerved running quite round, as alſo many little ſtrings by which it cleaves to every ſide of the Womb: but it is a little more ſmooth within, where it joyns every where, and unites with the <hi>Amnios,</hi> in ſuch a manner, as it appears, as we ſaid, but as one and the ſame Membrane. This <hi>Chorion</hi> covers the <hi>placenta</hi> and cleaves cloſe to the fore part of it, which reſpects the Infant, by means of the interlacing of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of Veſſels, and 'tis alſo principally faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Womb by the whole circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the <hi>placenta,</hi> in which part this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane is a little thicker.</p>
                  <p>Then the <hi>Amnios,</hi> which is the 2d Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane is 3 times thinner then the <hi>Chorion,</hi> and is within very ſmooth, but not juſt ſo much where 'tis joyned to the <hi>Chorion,</hi> This Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane is ſo thin that 'tis quite tranſparent, and hath no Veſſels in it, the which makes it ſo thin, as cannot be imagined without ſeing. This <hi>Amnios</hi> doth no ways touch the <hi>placenta,</hi> though it covers it, but it only lines all the inner part of the <hi>Chorion,</hi> which is between, and from which it may be wholly ſeparated if it be done with care.</p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:34775:95"/>
                  <p>The better to conceive this as it is, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner theſe Membranes are in the Womb, conſider the compoſition of a foot-ball; imagining the leather which covers it to be the Womb of a pregnant Woman, and the bladder blown up with wind, within the foot-ball, to be this double Membrane of the <hi>Chorion</hi> and <hi>Amnois,</hi> in which are contained together the Child and the waters; and even as the outſide of this bladder toucheth every where, becauſe 'tis blown up, the leather of the foot-ball; ſo in like manner the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the <hi>fetus</hi> are joyned on all ſides to the Womb; except where the burthen cleaves to it, in which place it paſſeth above it.</p>
                  <p>As to the 3d or rather pretended Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane which Authors call <hi>Alantoides,</hi> and ſay 'tis like, a ſauſage or girdle which ſurrounds and clothes the Infant from the ſword-like griſtle to juſt below the flanks only; 'tis very certain there never was any ſuch thing in any of thoſe Animals whoſe dams have but one young at a time, no more then Women, as Sheep, Cows, Mares, Aſſes, nor any other for ought could ever be learned from many curious enquiries.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes Infants, at their birth, bring forth theſe Membranes upon their head, and then 'tis ſaid they will be fortunate: which
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:34775:95"/> is a mere kind of ſuperſtition, becauſe it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens from the ſtrength of their ſubſtance, ſo that they cannot break by the impulſe of the waters, or the Womens throws in Labor, or becauſe the paſſages being very large, and the Infant very little, it paſſeth eaſily without any violence: and in this reſpect they may be ſaid to be fortunate, in being born ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the mother alſo for being ſo ſpeedily delivered: For in difficult Labors Children are never born with ſuch caps, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tormented and preſſed in the paſſage, theſe Membranes are broken and remain ſtill there.</p>
                  <p>Within the Infants Membranes, thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as I have ſaid, are the Waters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, in the midſt whereof it ſwims, and is ſeated; the original of which ſeems very incertain, if we regard the different opinions of Authors upon this ſubject, ſome will have them to be the Urine emptied out of the Bladder by the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachus,</hi> becauſe they cannot find the true and eaſie way for it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their color and ſavor much reſembles the Urine contained in the Bladder. But 'tis very certain that it cannot be ſo as they aver; becauſe the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachus</hi> is not perforated in the <hi>fetus,</hi> and it comes not forth of the Navil; for the place where 'tis faſtened, is always very like a ſmall Lute-ſtring, through
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:34775:96"/> which it is moſt certain nothing can paſs though never ſo ſubtile.</p>
                  <p>There are others alſo that will have theſe waters to be the Urine; but they are of an opinion that it paſſeth through the Yard whoſe paſſage is always open, and not by the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachus</hi> which is never hollow.</p>
                  <p>Now for my part as it appears to me, with more reaſon, and as indeed it is, theſe waters are only generated out of vaporous humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which ſweat out and exhale continually out of the Infants body, and meeting theſe Membranes through which they cannot paſs, becauſe they are too thick and cloſe, are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into water, which is thus by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle collected, as well during the firſt months of Conception, the Child not yet quick, as all the remaining part of the time, after it is quick; for vapors paſs forth and exhale out of all porous bodies that are hot and moiſt, as is that of an Embrio; and the reaſon is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weak by which they maintain theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to proceed from the Urine, becauſe they are ſalt as the urine is; For ſweat, tears, and other humors which diſtill and ſweat out of the body are as well ſalt as the Urine; of which the Infant whilſt it is in the Womb, cannot have much, no more then dung in the Guts; becauſe it receives no nouriſhment at the mouth at that time, &amp; that all its ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:34775:96"/> humors may eaſily paſs away by tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, through the ſubſtance of all the parts of its body, which is very tender; wherefore I cannot conceive any neceſſity to oblige them more to empty the Urine, which is in a ſmall quantity in the Bladder, then the excrements which are in the Guts, which is not then done in any manner, but only after the Child is born. <hi>Bartholinus</hi> and others would have the Infant however to empty its Urine through its Yard, and that theſe waters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from thence; but there is a greater probability it ſhould be vented by tranſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for before it is yet fully ſhaped and quick, there is notwithſtanding found a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable quantity of theſe waters to the bigneſs of its body: which makes it appear that it is then neither the Urine rendred by the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachus</hi> nor Yard, as all the World ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; and that which proves it more plainly is the example of ſome Children born with their Yards imperforated, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding have theſe waters, whilſt in the Womb,</p>
                  <p>And here it muſt be obſerved that when there is more then one Child, they are never in the ſame Membrane, unleſs their bodies are joined together, which is rare and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, but each have their Membranes and waters, apart.</p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:34775:97"/>
                  <p>Now theſe waters thus collected within theſe Membranes have divers very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble uſes; Firſt, They ſerve the Infant to move more eaſily, as it were by ſwiming from one ſide to the other, and that it may not hurt the Womb by its frequent motions in ſtriking dry againſt it, which would cauſe great pain, and often excite to Abortion; and they ſerve alſo very much to facilitate its paſſage in the birth making the way very ſlippery, and by that means the orifice of the Womb being moiſtened is better widened and yielding when they break, juſt when the Child is ready to follow, or a little before: for elſe remaining dry it is born with greater difficulty and the Mother alſo more torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it.</p>
                  <p>And now Mrs. <hi>Eutrap.</hi> having thus ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently as I hope, explained the Membranes of the <hi>fetus,</hi> and the waters contained in them. I think it may not be amiſs to ſay ſomething, in order of inquiring after the parts by which it is nouriſhed whilſt in the Womb: and and here Mrs. <hi>Eutrap.</hi> ſince, as was ſaid in the beginning that it is only nouriſhed by its Mothers blood; and that I am of opinion that big-bellied Women have none that is fair or good; provident nature hath formed the <hi>placenta</hi> to ſerve it for a Magazine, that it may always have ſufficient, and be there
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:34775:97"/> again elaborated and perfected, to render it more convenient for its nouriſhment; for without doubt ſo groſs a blood as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cannot poſſibly be converted into its ſubſtance, if it were not firſt purified in the <hi>placenta,</hi> which is afterwards ſent to it by means of the umbelical veins and brought back, as we ſhall ſhew hereafter, by the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which are the conduits of which the Navil-ſtring is compoſed. We ſay then that the <hi>placenta</hi> is nothing but a ſpungy and fleſhy maſs ſomewhat like the ſubſtance of the ſpleen, woven and interlaced with an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of Veins and Arteries, which compoſe the greateſt part of the body, made to receive the Mothers blood appointed for the Infants nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p>This maſs is ſo called, becauſe it reſembles a cake, alſo it may be call'd the delivery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being come forth after the Child is born the Woman is quite delivered of her burthen, it is alſo call'd the after-burthen, becauſe it is as a 2d Labor, of which the Woman is not diſcharged till after the Child be born: ſome give it the name of liver of the Womb, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſay it ſerves as a liver, to prepare the blood appointed for the Infants nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>Laurentius</hi> calls it the ſweet bread of the Womb, and appoints it the ſame uſe, as that of the lower belly, to wit for a reſt
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:34775:98"/> and ſupport to the Veſſels of the Navil which diſperſeth an infinite number of branches throughout all its ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>Now this <hi>placenta</hi> is made of the menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood of the Mother, which flows into the Womb, by the accumulation of which it is formed; its ſhape is flat and round, about the bigneſs of a Trencher, and 2 fingers breadth thick about the middle, where the umbilical Veſſels are faſtened, but is thinner towards the edges. It is covered with the <hi>Chorion</hi> and <hi>Amnios</hi> on the ſide next the Infant, and on the other ſide 'tis joined and faſtned to the bottom on the inſide of the Womb; It is ſtrongeſt faſtned to the Womb (with its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference) by the <hi>Chorion,</hi> which cleaves ſo cloſe to it by the interlacings of an infinity of Veſſels, which appear very large in its ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, that it cannot be ſeparated from it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tearing its ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>Though there be 2 or 3 Children in the Womb begot in the ſame act, they have uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally but one common after-burthen, which hath as many Navil-ſtrings as Children, which are notwithſtanding ſeparated from one another by their ſeveral Membranes, in each being the Children and waters: but if they be ſuperfetations there will be as many burthens as Children; and as ſuperfetations happen but rarely, ſo there are few Women
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:34775:98"/> that have their burthens ſeparated when they are delivered of ſeveral Children.</p>
                  <p>We ſcarce find any Creature but a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that hath an Afterburthen, like this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and diſchargeth it as uſeleſs as ſoon as the Child is born; for moſt other Animals caſt forth nothing after their young, except the waters only and ſome ſlimes with the skins which ſurround them, and in lieu of this fleſhy maſs, thoſe which, as a Woman, have but one at a time, have only ſome <hi>cotyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dones,</hi> or many ſpungy kernels joyn'd inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the proper ſubſtance of their Womb, which terminates all the branches of the um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belical Veſſels of their Young; which Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels as I have often obſerved in cutting up Sheep, when they were not with young, are not bigger then hemp-ſeed; but when they were with young, they ſwell'd as big as one thumb, one bigger, and one leſſer; and then they reſembled the Figure of a round muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, on the outſide, not yet ſpread after it's cut from its ſtalk; and to each of theſe ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, are faſtned the branches of the umbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Veſſels: however thoſe that have more then one at a time, as Bitches, Rabbits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have no kernels; inſtead of which each young hath in its celule a kind of particular <hi>placenta,</hi> which the dam eats as ſoon as ſhe voids it, after ſhe hath knawn off the umbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:34775:99"/> Veſſels that hold it. But theſe thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fitter for Phyſitians and Chyrurgions to be contemplated on, I ſhall proceed no farther to diſcourſe thereon; and ſhall only deſire you to note, that thoſe Veſſels appointed for the nouriture of the <hi>fetus</hi> are bigger then they are in Men, becauſe of their hollowneſs, and as ſoon as the Child is born, dry up, and that part of them which is without the belly falls off, and is ſeparated cloſe to the Navil 5 or 6 days after; for which reaſon they loſe their firſt uſe, and begin after to degenerate into ſuſpending ligaments, to wit, the vein into that of the liver, and the 2 Arteries ſerve to extend and ſuſtain the bladder, by the ſide, where they are joined to it; the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of which is yet ſuſpended by the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachus,</hi> which comes not through the Navil, as hath been ſaid, but remains ſo pendent all the reſt of its life: and now Mrs. I come to know how you uſe to fetch away the after-burthen, with the ſtring and when 'tis broken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Mid.</label> That I ſhall freely do Sir, withal my heart; and therefore Sir you muſt note that the afterbirth being a uſeleſs thing to the Woman when the Child is born, ſhe muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after be freed of that alſo; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as ſoon as the Child is born, before I do ſo much as tye or cut the Navil-ſtring, leſt the Womb cloſe, I muſt without time looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:34775:99"/> eaſe the Woman of this fleſhy maſs; To perform which having taken the ſtring, I muſt wind it once or twice about one or 2 of her fingers of her left hand joyn'd together, the better to hold it, with which ſhe may then draw it moderately, and with her right hand ſhe may only take a ſingle hold of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the left, near the Privities, drawing like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with that very gently, reſting the while the fore finger of the ſame hand ſtretched forth along the ſtring towards the entry of the ſheath of the Womb, as may be ſeen in the annexed Figure, always obſerving, for the more facility, to draw it from the ſide where the burthen cleaves leaſt, for in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſt will ſeparate the better; as we ſee a card which is glewed to any thing is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeparated from the place where it begins to part then where it is cloſe joyned. But above all things care muſt be had that it be not drawn forth with two much violence, leſt breaking the ſtring near the burthen, I be oblig'd to put up my whole hand into the Womb, to deliver the Woman; or that the Womb, to which it is very ſtrongly faſtned ſometimes be not drawn forth with it; or a very great flooding be caus'd: wherefore for theſe reaſons it ſhall be gently ſhaken and drawn forth by little and little, and to faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate the better its expulſion, the Woman
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:34775:100"/> may the whilſt blow ſtrongly into her hands ſhut, as one does into the mouth of a bottle, to know if it be broke; or put her finger into her Throat, as if ſhe would cauſe vomiting, or ſtrive as if ſhe were going to ſtool; bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always down and holding her breath as ſhe did to bring forth her Child; and if after all this I meet with difficulty, you may, if need be, after you know on which ſide it is ſeated, deſire an experienced Nurſe keeper to preſs the belly lightly with her flat hand, directing it gently downwards by way of chaffing, not too boiſtrouſly.</p>
                  <p>But if all this be in vain then I muſt direct my hand into the Womb; to ſeparate it, as you ſhall hear anon.</p>
                  <p>Then I muſt conſider if there be all, and take care that the leaſt part remain not, not ſo much as the skirts, or any clods of blood; and this is the way to deliver a woman of her after-birth; but ſometimes the Midwife by endeavouring it breaks the ſtring by pulling too ſtrongly, or becauſe 'tis very weak; or elſe ſo putrified when the Child is dead that the leaſt pull breaks it off cloſe to the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, the which by that means is left behind in the Womb, or becauſe it cleaves to ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or the Woman is weak, and cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell it, being much tired by a long Labor, or becauſe it was ſpeedily drawn forth after La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:34775:100"/> the Womb cloſeth ſo as it leaves it no paſſage, and cannot without much difficulty be dilated to fetch it away, becauſe it remains dry after the natural ſlime and humidities are paſt: and ſeeing that if it remain behind 'tis capable of deſtroying the Woman, we muſt ſee to get it away as before, and if the Navil-ſtring happen to break near the burthen, I muſt immediately introduce my hand into the Womb before it cloſe, being anointed with oyl or freſh butter, to ſeparate it from the Womb gently and draw it forth with the clods of blood that remain. When the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſtring is not broken, it will eaſily conduct the hand, but when 'tis we have no longer this guide; wherefore I muſt be then very careful that I be not deceived in taking one part for another; as I once ſaw a Midwife pull the Womb near the inward orifice in lieu of the burthen.</p>
                  <p>Aſſoon then as I have introduced my hand into the Womb towards its bottom, I ſhall find the burthen which I ſhall know by a great number of little inequalities, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made there, by the roots of the umbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Veſſels, on the ſide where they terminate, which makes it to be eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the Womb; if it yet cleave to it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding 'tis then a little wrinkled and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; becauſe its Membranes which were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

                  <p>Now if I find the burthen wholly looſen'd from the Womb, it will be eaſy to draw it forth, when I have got it into my hands, but if it cleaves, finding the ſide to which it ſticks leaſt, I muſt begin there to ſeparate it gently, by putting ſome of my Fingers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt it and the Womb; continuing by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little to do ſo, till it be quite looſe, and then draw it forth very carefully; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the whilſt, if it cannot be otherwiſe, rather to leave ſome part thereof behind, than to ſcrape or ſcratch the leaſt part of the Womb, for fear of a flooding, inflammation, or Gangrene, which cauſe death; being alſo careful not to draw it forth, till it be wholly or the moſt part of it ſeparated, for fear of drawing forth the Womb with it, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it as whole as theſe cautions will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, becauſe of ſhewing it to the company, that they may know I have performed my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice well.</p>
                  <p>But if the Midwife ſhall not find the Womb open enough to direct her hand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately into it, let her preſently anoint the Womans Privities with hogs greaſe then by little and little put up her hand, and let
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:34775:101"/> the Woman contribute as before; but if for all this ſhe cannot void the After-birth, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void a greater miſchief I muſt leave it to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, aſſiſting her with remedies which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purate: wherefore injections into the womb are proper, made of Mallows, Marſh-mallows, Pellitory of the Wall, and Linſeed, in which is to be mixed a good quantity of Oil of Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies or freſh butter; and to haſten the work give her a ſtrong Clyſter, that ſo by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to go to ſtool, it may cauſe it to be voided, as it hath arrived to many that have rendred it in the Bed-pan; and ſometimes when they have leaſt expected it.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time, to prevent a Feaver or many other accidents which uſually happen, ſhe may be let blood in the Arm or Foot, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it ſhall be convenient; and ſtrengthen'd, that the cadaverous vapors coming from the putrifaction of the burthen aſcend not to the heart and noble parts, which muſt be done by good cordials often uſed, not ſuch as are made of Treacle and Methri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which no reaſon can be given, but their ſpecific, or rather imaginary Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and are fitter to cauſe vomiting, then comfort the heart: But with true Cordials which are ſuch as yield good nouriſhment, and at the ſame time comfort the ſtomach, without offending it, as thoſe drugs do
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:34775:102"/> which are only good for thoſe that ſell them.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I muſt order her good broths and gellies; and to drink Orengade or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monade, or to put ſome Syrup of Lemons in her refreſhing Liquors; or if ſhe be free from a Feaver a little wine and water mixed; which is the beſt and moſt natural of all Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials. Beſides other remedies muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, according to the accidents that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by reaſon of the ſtaying behind of the burthen; always remembring to bring it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as ſoon as poſſible, for as long as it ſtays in the Womb the woman feels great pains continually, almoſt like them before her Child was born; and until the whole be void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the pains will ſtill be repeated although in vain, unleſs the matter be well diſpoſed before; but the leſſer the piece is of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained burthen, the more difficult 'tis many times to be expelled; becauſe the impulſe, the woman can make by helping her throws, are not ſo great, when the matter contained in the Womb is ſmall, as when 'tis of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable bigneſs; for then 'tis more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thruſt and compreſs'd; which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why a woman miſcarries with greater difficulty then when brought to bed at her full time.</p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:34775:102"/>
                  <p>And here you muſt know there are divers Midwifes, who having broken the Navil-ſtring as before ſaid, leave their work im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect; and commit the reſt to nature's work; but very often the poor woman dyes, becauſe of the great miſchiefs which uſually happen before the ſuppuration of the burthen ſo retained: The which to avoid when they meet with the like caſe, I would adviſe them to fetch it away, as I have directed: or if they find themſelves uncapable to do it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the hand muſt be put up into the Womb, which is more properly the work of a Phyſitian or Chyrurgion, expert in thoſe caſes; then let them immediately ſend for one, that ſo he may be able, before the Womb cloſeth to introduce his hand, for the longer 'tis deferr'd the more difficult will the work be.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> 3. <hi>Accidental.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">Natural is when the inſtrument of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration being perfect in both Sexes, no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful or unskilful means uſed to cauſe it, yet the Woman remains naturally Barren, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Age or Diſeaſes, or natural defect hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, yet ſhe Conceives not.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon of this may be 1. When both Sexes are of a Complexion; 2. Want of Love, a 3d may be the letting Virgins blood i'th Arm, before their Courſes come down; or other ill adminiſtration of internal and external remedies. 4. A loſs of carnal Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; when Sexes come to the School of <hi>Venus,</hi> either not at all, or ſo coldly, that as
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:34775:104"/> good never a whit, as nere the better; and this is from a cold Diſtemper, and is cured by ſuch things as heat and nouriſh.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Unnatural, that is diabolical, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which Authors have left ſeveral ways, as to carry the Herb St. <hi>Johns</hi> wort about them, which is call'd a driver away of Devils, or a Plaiſter thereof applied to the Reins, with many others.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Accidental,</hi> which comes by ſome caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al infirmity upon the body of either Sex at a time, the which being taken away the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ceaſeth: 'tis ſometimes from the Man, but moſt commonly from the Woman; for Mans inſtruments of Generation being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and he in health, I know no accidental cauſe in him; And the chief cauſe in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men lyes in her Womb; as the ſtopping of the flowers, or overflowing; the Flux of the Womb, its falling down, inflamation, windi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, heat and dryneſs; in all which I ſhall be brief, becauſe if there be difficulty, you are to have recourſe to the learned Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then the Terms ſtop, 1. <hi>Naturally,</hi> 2. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nnaturally;</hi> they ſtop naturally in ſome about the 50th year, in ſome before, rarely
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:34775:104"/> till 55. the unnatural cauſe is, 1. much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, 2. in fat Women the Veins are nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and blood turns to fat, 3. by long ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, 4. when they have the piles in lieu of their Terms, 5. a hot or cold diſtemper of the Womb, 6. care, fear, grief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall ſpeak here only of the 5th for cauſes of the laſt being taken away the effect ceaſes; and the reſt the ingenious Midwife will remedy. Now ſeeing theſe ſtoppings come uſually from default of the Womb, the beſt way to help it is by ſtrengthening the Womb, firſt then you ſhall prepare your way; if there be occaſion let blood i'th the foot, if ſhe be not full of humors, if ſhe be, then in the Arm firſt, which I have moſt commonly known to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: then if need be give her a draught of White-wine wherein an handful of Centaury or ſtinking <hi>Arach</hi> hath been boiled; and if there be a pain in the head add an handful of Verven; or ſome Parcely roots, Fennel, or Lowage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not forgetting in fulneſs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors to purge with half a dram of <hi>Extractum Rudii,</hi> and as much <hi>Pil. Maſtichinae</hi> mixt, made into 12 Pills, whereof take 3 at Night going to bed, or after her firſt ſleep.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Terms overflow, 1. when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue longer then their uſual time, which is 2 or 3 days, in Women that uſe no exerciſe
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:34775:105"/> 4 or 5 days, 2. when they come oftner then once a month, the cauſe is 1. a Rupture of ſome Veſſel, 2. immoderate purgation, 3. ſome corroding humor, 4. hard Labor in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, or unkind handing the Womb: if the Veſſels be broken, blood guſheth out in heaps, and if from ſome knawing humor, they are few but very painful; the reſt are eaſily known. Let them abſtain from exerciſe; then 1. anoint the reins with Oil of Roſes, Myrtles or Quinces; then boil the roots of Tormentil, Cinquefoil, Yarrow, Knot-graſs, Comfrey, dead Nettles, Solomon's Seal, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlan, Shepherds-purſe, red Roſes, acorn Cups, bark of Oak Trees, ſome of theſe, in her or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary drink; or the juices of what can be had taken alone, and this above all, take Comfrey leaves or roots and Clowns alheal, of each an handful; bruiſe and boil them well in Ale, and drink of it now and then, this will do though the Veſſels were open.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Flux of the Womb,</hi> is a continual drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that part of the body; if it be red like putrified blood it comes from that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor; if white and pale, 'tis from Phlegm. if yellow, 'tis from Choler; if pure blood; as if a vein were opened either a knawing of the Womb, or tearing in delivery is feared. The cure differs as the cauſe, if pure blood
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:34775:105"/> flow, let blood i'th arm, then uſe the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine laſt mentioned, of Comfrey roots and Woundworth; if flegm be the cauſe, uſe Cinnamon in all meats and drinks, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridate and Treacle for Antidotes, a little every Morning; take a ſcruple of Pills of Amber going to Bed for divers Nights; if from Choler, purge with ſyrup of Violets, and <hi>Caſſia Fistularis</hi> of each an ounce; after take powder of Ivory and Misſleto of the oak, of each one ſcruple, mixt with half an ounce of conſerve of Roſes; every Morning for a Week; if from putrified blood having firſt let blood i'th Foot, then ſtrengthen the Womb, as before: always forbearing vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent motions and paſſions, and ſharp and ſalt meats; and provokers of Urine: for dead Nettles there are three ſorts, white, red, and yellow, the flowers of that colour, the white help the white, the red, the red, the yellow the yellow flux.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Womb</hi> fallen out is cured; if it be ſwell'd by bathing it with a decoction of Mallows, Linſeed and Fennigreek boil'd in water, 2 or 3 times; and when 'tis got up let her keep her Legs cloſe, or elſe tye them with a ſwath; apply ſtinking things to the Womb, as <hi>Aſſa Foetida,</hi> oil of Amber, her own Hair burnt; and let her ſmell of Civet,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:34775:106"/> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the reſt is before and after.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>Womb</hi> is inflamed by many cauſes, a blow, ſtopping of the Terms, Abortion, Ulceration, Immoderate Lechery, overmuch walking; cold. For cure, ſtrengthen the Womb firſt; then firſt clarifie Whey and boil Plantain leaves or roots in it; and drink it, then inject the juice of Plantain into the Womb with a Syringe; if in Winter, when you cannot get the juice make a ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the leaves and roots in water; if the body be coſtive uſe a Clyſter: and here note that in all Inflammations blood-letting is the chiefeſt remedy, firſt i'th Arm, then if need i'th Foot; if it be near the Neck of the Womb, make a peſſary of wool and anoint it with <hi>unguent. album,</hi> or <hi>populeon,</hi> or mixt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Womb is ſometimes troubled with wind, which is cured as the fits of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and moiſtneſs of the Womb is cured as a flux of flegm.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Heat and dryneſs of the Womb is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to Women of a Cholerick complexion, is cured by cool and moiſtning herbs, of which ſtinking <hi>Arach</hi> is chief, neither are Plantan and Mallows much behind; milk is good for ſuch to drink, firſt purging with an
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:34775:106"/> ounce of <hi>Caſſia Fiſtula</hi> new drawn going to bed, and follow your buſineſs the next day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Dr.</label> Thus far good, Mrs. <hi>Eutrap.</hi> but now hear me a little concerning this matter.</p>
                  <p>All rational men know, that the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mankind, as alſo of other irrational Animals, is the moſt perfect, excellent and exquiſite work of God's Vicegerent <hi>Nature;</hi> the which is moſt excellently, and elegantly demonſtrated, and ſet forth by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that great Secretary of <hi>Nature,</hi> in his ſecond Book which he hath written of the <hi>Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of living <hi>Creatures;</hi> for whereas it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, by the decree of Nature, that any humane Creature ſhould live always, or have an immortal Being in this World; much leſs ſhould we imagine that ſhould be granted to Bruits and other Souls of an inferior rank; therefore, for the continuance and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of each ſort, it hath otherwiſe ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that during the continuance of this World, there ſhould be likewiſe maintained a ſucceſſive generation of both Sexes, by the Action of procreation; and from hence, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, <hi>Galen</hi> the greateſt Luminary of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick next <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> ſays, that it comes to paſs that Creatures are furniſhed with Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Generation, proper for the quality
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:34775:107"/> of their Sex; and are conſequently indued with natural Inſtincts prompting them to the uſe thereof: Therefore we ſhall at this time diſcourſe of this wonderful operation of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> and endeavour, as far forth as our Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent will afford us, to ſeek out the cauſes that may hinder, and from thence preſcribe means to remove them, and ſo conſequently aſſiſt and further her in ſo miraculous a concern: and this partly upon our Dame nature's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, whoſe Servants only we are; and in the next place for the ſakes of thoſe Ladies, Gentlewomen and others, who are often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate and dejected, upon their being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted barren.</p>
                  <p>Now then you muſt note that as concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath ſome alliance with every part of the Body, as being undoubtedly concern'd therein, ſo the ſame Conception may be quite aboliſhed, diminiſhed, or deprived as it happens in all other actions and motions of the body; ſo that if Conception be quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh'd in a Woman, in ſuch ſort that ſhe can never be able to conceive; this affection is then called <hi>Barrenneſs;</hi> or ſuch a Woman may be called a barren Woman, which you pleaſe. But if ſhe Conceive ſometimes, though ſeldome, here the Conceptive faculties may be ſaid to be diminiſhed; or weakened by
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:34775:107"/> ſome cauſe or other; and to this kind of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed Conception may be referr'd untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly births, called Abortion; And laſtly a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Conception is when in the Womb is contained ſome unnatural Conception, ſuch as Monſters and <hi>Mola</hi>'s, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The cauſes and remedies of all which it hath and ſhall be our duty to lay open to the Females Sex, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the beſt of our skil and knowledge: firſt to the end we may further the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of humane kind, and ſecondly, that we make if poſſibly remove the reproaches laid upon Barrenneſs, which hath been in all ages, and continues to this day and will do to end of the World; and than which there can hardly happen a greater defamation to the Female Sex. Inſomuch as ſome like <hi>Rachel</hi> have cry'd out to their Husbands for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; or elſe their Lives will lye on't, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than endure the reproach of Barrenneſs, and ſome Women have preferr'd their maids to their Husbands, ſo that their Child might be reputed theirs, to take away the blemiſh of Barrenneſs; But you ſhall find but few Women of their minds now a days: ſo then we ſhall in the firſt place ſpeak of the cauſes of this ſo odious and diſtateful a Diſeaſe, and then of their removing; for you know 'tis an old ſaying and true, take away the cauſe and the effect will conſequently ceaſe.</p>

                  <p>Now the chief method of finding out all cauſes which do or may bring damage, to the faculties of the body, is no other then the knowledge of the means whereby theſe facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties perform their Actions, in the time of health and ſoundneſs of body. And whereas to the producing of any natural Conception there is a neceſſity of diſtinction of both Sexes and a conjunction and carnal Copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Man and Woman, without which no Generation can be effected. As for that ſtory of a certain Maids conceiving with Child by ſtanding in a Bath, where ſome Mans ſeed had been caſt, the Womb draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to it, as the Load-ſtone doth Iron, or Jet ſtraw, it was either a miracle in Nature, or ſhe ſo gave out to ſave her bacon; and ſo no ways belongs to our purpoſe, and having before declared the manner in other Sect. Therefore we ſhall here lay down the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt cauſes of Barrenneſs from either Sex, ſo that neither may be unjuſtly blamed where they happen; for ſince the Women have, in this caſe a great intereſt, and damage too if the fault be in the Man; becauſe they may often help their Husbands defect, and in ſo doing pleaſure themſelves, we ſhall not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore omit to treat of the cauſes thereof which may happen to men; and moreover
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:34775:109"/> there being a neceſſity that both Sexes be furniſhed with fit and proper Inſtruments for the work of Generation, as the man with a Yard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a Woman with a Womb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then even reaſon will tell you, that if there chance to be any defect or diſſaffection in nature in any of the Members, of either Sex, belonging to this work of Generation, the fruitfulneſs or Conception muſt neceſſarily be hindred, impaired, or quite and clear abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</p>
                  <p>To begin then firſt with what belongs to the Mans ſide; one cauſe of Barrenneſs laid down by many Authors is the over-much length of the Yard; by reaſon whereof the Seed is too much cooled in the paſſage before it can be injected home into the Womb. But though this be a ſomewhat probable and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable reaſon; yet I am of opinion that it is but weak and will not hold water with thoſe of greater reaſon; (for all Souls are not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a like proportion of reaſon;) for the Seed paſſing through the pipe of the Yard is kept hot enough, the generative Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits at that time oft flocking to the Yard to aſſiſt it in ſo great a work; and the like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing performed on the Woman's part, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee how it can be any ways poſſible it ſhould take cold in its journey; but on the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:34775:110"/> contrary ſide it may be rationally imagin'd that the long Yard is moſt fit and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for Conception, by ſending Seed to the inmoſt and furthermoſt parts of the Womb, and ſo moſt likely to be there retained, its due time.</p>
                  <p>And now others on the contrary ſide will have the ſhort Yard the cauſe of rendring Men unfruitful; and theſe I think have more reaſon on their ſide, becauſe it cannot ſo well inject the Seed into the Womb, as you heard before; But indeed neither can this be a firm reaſon, for unfruitfulneſs in Man; ſince 'tis confirmed by experience that ſuch an one hath begot Children likewiſe. But a greater reaſon of unfruitfulneſs in the man may be ſome vitiouſneſs or defect in his Yard; as if it be crooked, or if any of its Ligaments be writhed, or broken or bruiſed; whereby the paſſages through which the ſeed ſhould flow be corrupt, ſtop'd or vitiated; or ſome Diſeaſe or imperfection be either in the proper or Neighbor parts thereof.</p>
                  <p>Another cauſe of Barrenneſs by defect of the Yard, is a too much weakneſs and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs thereof, it being not ſtrongly enough erected to inject the Seed into the Womb.</p>

                  <p>Then another cauſe in Men may be ſome vice in the Stones, as if they be oppreſſed with any Inflammation, or ſwelling, or wound, or ulcer.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the Man may be Barren from his want of Seed, or if it be nought; as in the Running of the Reins or Venereal Diſeaſe, Glutony or Drunkenneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then too frequent Carnal Copulation, is a cauſe of Barrenneſs, becauſe it attracteth the Seedy moiſture from the Stones before 'tis ſufficiently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; and concocted, as all other members of the body, by inſtitution of nature, uſe to draw their accuſtomed juice to themſelves, ſo now if any one by daily Copulation draws out all the moiſture of his Seed, then do the Stones draw the moiſt humors from the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Veins to themſelves, and ſo having but a little blood in them they are forced, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to caſt it out raw; and thus the ſtones being deprived of the moiſture of their veins, draw the ſame from the upper veins, and the upper veins from all the parts of the body, for their proper nutriment, to the great damage of the body, robbing the ſame of the vital Spirits.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore no wonder if thoſe that uſe immoderate Copulation are very weak in
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:34775:111"/> their bodies, ſeeing the whole body is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by depriv'd of its beſt and pureſt blood and vital Spirits; inſomuch as thoſe that have been too much addicted to that pleaſure, have killed themſelves in the Act; can it then be a wonder that ſuch Seed is not fit for Generation?</p>
                  <p>And having now ſhewn the cauſes of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs in Men, we ſhall now diſcourſe of thoſe in Women; Now the cauſes of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs in Women proceed either from the Age, or evil temper of the Womb, and its vicious conformation, and parts depending on it, or the indiſpoſition of the whole ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the body; The evil form of the womb renders Women barren, according to the great <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the Prince of all Phyſitians, as if the mouth or neck of the Womb be turned backwards towards the great Gut, or a ſide out of its place, contrary from the Privities; if it appear too big, or if it be fallen down before the Privities; to which may be added when 'tis ſo narrow that it cannot admit the Yard to enter, and when 'tis wholly, or in part cloſed by ſome inward or outward skin, which is very rare, if at all; or by a ſwelling colloſity, or cicatrice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:34775:111"/>
                  <p>But then it is not ſufficient that the Mans Yard enter the Neck, which is the Anti-Chamber to the Womb, for if in the act of Copulation, he knock at the door which is the inward orifice, and it be not opened, all is to no purpoſe; and this may likewiſe be hindred from opening, by ſome calloſity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from abundance of ill humors, which uſually flow from the Matrix, or from ſome ſwelling which may happen to it, or alſo by ſome part which may ſo preſs it, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not open to receive the Seed as the <hi>cawl</hi> doth in fat Women; according to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who ſays they cannot conceive till they grow lean.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt frequent reaſon why this ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice opens not in this Act, to receive the ſeed, is the inſenſibility of ſome Women, who take no pleaſure in the Venereal Act; but when they have an appetite, the Womb being covetuous of the Seed opens it ſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</p>
                  <p>The ſame <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſeems to have noted all the ſigns and cauſes of Barrenneſs from the evil temper of the Womb, when he ſaith in his 62<hi>th Aphoriſm,</hi> book 5. that all ſuch Women whoſe Womb is cold and cloſe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive, nor they who have it too moiſt,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:34775:112"/> becauſe the Seed is extinguiſhed in it; and likewiſe ſuch who have it too dry and hot, becauſe for want of aliment the ſeed cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts; but ſuch as are of a moderate temper are fruitful. Of all which in my opinion the moſt common is the cortinual moiſture of the Womb fed by an abundance of the whites with which many are much inconvenienced, the humors of the whole dody being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſtear their courſe this way, which can very hardly be turned away when invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and the Womb being imbued with theſe vicious moiſtures, becomes inwardly ſo unctious and ſlippery, that the ſeed though glutinous, cannot cleave to it; nor be retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within it, and that's the cauſe it ſlips away immediately, or ſhortly after 'tis received.</p>
                  <p>Barrenneſs may alſo proceed from the whole habit, as when a Woman is too old, or too young; for the Seed of the young is not prolific, neither have they menſtruous blood, both which are requiſite to fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that of the aged is in ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and too cold, who likewiſe want menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood; then, an univerſal diſtemper, though of convenient years, renders them Barren, as when they are Hectick, Dropſical, Sickly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and eſpecially ſo much the more as the whole parts are fallen from their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:34775:112"/> and natural conſtitution. There are how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever many Women, which ſeem Barren for a long time, by reaſon of ſome of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned reaſons, yea till 35 or 40 years old, and ſometimes longer who yet at laſt conceive being cured of the diſtempers which hindered them, and having changed their temperament by their Age.</p>
                  <p>Now ſome of theſe Barrenneſſes may be cured by removing their cauſes, and procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſpoſitions needful to fertility; yea of thoſe proceeding from an univerſal intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament by reducing their body, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient regiment, to a good order, according to their reſpective diſpoſitions. Wherefore if one have the Neck of the Womb narrow, and not from ſome of the cauſes aboveſaid, ſhe ought to be joyned to a Man whoſe Yard is proportionable; and if that will not do, which happens very ſeldom, ſhe muſt relax it, and open it with ſoftning oils, and ointments; If it be compreſſed by any humor it muſt be reſolved and ſuppurated, according to its nature and ſituation, having always a care to prevent the corruption of theſe parts which are very ſubject to it, being hot and moiſt; becauſe the Womb ſerves, as a ſink by which all the bad humors of the body are purged; ſo that you muſt take great care
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:34775:113"/> that theſe ſwellings turn not to a Cancer.</p>
                  <p>When the Neck is not clear by reaſon of any ſcar, after a rent, cauſed by ſome violence, or hard labor, or after an Ulcer which cauſed the two ſides to be agglutinated, whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly or outwardly it muſt be ſeperated, which being the Chirurgeon's work, I here omit it.</p>
                  <p>If the inward orifice of the Womb be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plac'd, it may be in ſome ſort remedied by making the Woman obſerve a convenient poſture in the act of Generation; and if the whites or other impurities of the Womb, cauſe Barrenneſs, they muſt be helped by eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations, purgations, and a regular dyet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which the learned Phyſitian is to be conſulted.</p>

                     <hi>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>perfaetation</hi> according to the diſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> is a repeated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, that is when a Woman being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with Child, conceives again the 2 d time, now there is a great diſpute about this; for we ſee daily Bitches, Sows and Rabits, have divers young but with one Copulation, which may make us judge the ſame of a Woman; ſome will have this to be by <hi>Superfetation,</hi> but there are ſigns by which we may know the difference, whether both Children were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got at once, or one after the other. That which makes many believe there can be no ſuch thing as <hi>ſuperfetation,</hi> is becauſe as ſoon as a Woman hath conceived, her Womb cloſeth firmly ſo that the Man's ſeed, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to conception, finding no place nor entry, cannot be received, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, ſo as to cauſe this 2d concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To this may be added, That a bearing Woman diſchargeth her ſeed, which is as neceſſary as a Mans, by a Veſſel which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates on the ſide of the outward part of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:34775:114"/> the inward Orifice; which ſeed by this means is ſhed into the Neck of the Womb, and not into the bottom; as it ought, for this purpoſe. However it may be ſaid in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, to theſe objections, which are very ſtrong; that though the Womb be clos'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet this general rule may have ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; ſo that it may be ſometimes open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to let paſs ſome ſlimy excrements which by their ſtay offend it; or chiefly when a Woman is animated with an earneſt deſire of Copulation, in the heat of which action ſhe ſometimes diſchargeth by the paſſage that terminates in the bottom of the Womb, which being opened by the impetuous endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of the ſeed, more then ordinarily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heated, and this Orifice being at the ſame time a little opened, if the Man's ſeed be darted into it at the ſame moment, 'tis thought a Woman may then conceive again. This may be confirmed by a ſtory of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant related by <hi>Pliny,</hi> who having the ſame day copulated with two ſeveral Perſons, brought forth two Children, the one reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling her Maſter, the other his Proctor: and alſo by a ſtory of another Woman, who had two Children, one like her Husband and the other like her Galant; but this different reſemblance doth not always prove <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetation,</hi> becauſe ſometimes different ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:34775:114"/> may cauſe the like effect.</p>
                  <p>The 2d Conception is effectively as ſure, as we find the deciſion thereof uncertain; nor muſt we imagine that always when a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man brings forth two Children, or more at once, there is a <hi>ſuperfetation;</hi> becauſe they are always almoſt begot in the ſame Act, by the abundance of both Seeds received into the Womb; neither muſt we believe that it may be at all times of a Womans being with Child; for it cannot be either the firſt or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day of Conception; becauſe if the laſt Seed be received into the Womb, it would make confuſion with the firſt, which is not yet enwrapt with this little skin, that might otherwiſe ſeparate it, nor is formed perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly till the ſixth or ſeventh day; as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaw in a Woman, who about that time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled this geniture: Beſides the Matrix open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf again could not hinder the firſt Seed from ſlipping out; being not as yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellopt with this little skin, which could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it. This may make one not to believe <hi>Pliny</hi>'s ſtory; that it happened for his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to wit, that ſhe uſed Copulation with two ſeveral Perſons the ſame day; for the laſt would certainly have cauſed this confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Seeds, and alſo have deſtroyed the work begun: But I rather believe that this <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetation</hi>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:34775:115"/> may happen from the 6th day of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, till the 30th or 40th at moſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then the Seeds are covered with Skins, and that which is contained in the Womb, is not of a conſiderable bigneſs: but after this time it is impoſſible, or yet at leaſt very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, becauſe the Womb being extended more and more by the growth of the Child can hardly receive new Seed &amp; as hardly retain it; but caſts it forth by reaſon of its fulneſs; and 'tis a true Maxim, <hi>intus existens prohibet alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now when a Woman brings forth one or more Children at a Birth, begotten at once which uſually are called Twins, (and differs from <hi>ſuperfetation</hi>) 'tis known by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt of an equal thickneſs and bigneſs, and having but one only and common after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth; not ſeparated the one from the other, but by their Skins, which wrap each a part with their waters, and not both in the ſame waters and skin; as ſome have believed; but if there be ſeveral Children and a <hi>ſuperfeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> they will alſo be ſeparated by their Skins, but not have a common burthen, but each a part; neither will they be of an equal bigneſs, for that which is the <hi>ſuperfetation</hi> is always leſſer and weaker, then that which was firſt engendred; who becauſe of its force
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:34775:115"/> and vigor draws to it ſelf the greateſt and beſt part of the nouriſhment; juſt as we find in fair and great fruit, that have often near them very little ones; which happens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe that are firſt knotted and faſtned to the Tree, take away all their nouriſhment from their Neighbours, which did but bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom when the firſt had acquir'd ground and bigneſs: and ſometimes Twins are not of an equal bigneſs, which happens as the one or other hath more ſtrength to draw to it in greater abundance the beſt part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p>Now I am not willing to ſay that there is never any <hi>ſuperfetation;</hi> but I ſay that it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens very rarely; for of an hundred Women that have Twins, ninety have but one bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then common to both, which is a very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſign they had no <hi>ſuperfetation,</hi> and much more certain then the obſervations taken from the greatneſs, or ſtrength of the Child, which is but conjectural.</p>
                  <p>And thus have I given you Mrs. my full ſentiments concerning this ſo much diſputed and intricate matter: Now I pray you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the other diſtempers accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Women before Child-Birth.</p>

                  <p>
                     <label>Mid.</label> VOmitting with ſuppreſſion of the Terms, are for the moſt part the firſt accident, and the means by which they perceive they have conceived. 'Tis not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways cauſed from ill humors in the ſtomach, becauſe of the ſtopping of the courſes; for theſe corrupted humors cauſe rather a depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved appetite then this vomiting, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens immediately after Conception, and comes by ſucceſſion; but theſe firſt vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings proceed from the Sympathy between the ſtomach and the Womb, becauſe of the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſubſtance, and by means of the Nerves inſerted in the upper Orifice of the Stomach, which have communication, by continuity, with thoſe that paſs to the Womb, being portions of the 6th pair of thoſe of the brain. Now the Womb, being a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſible part beginning to grow bigger, feels ſome pain, which being communicated by this continuity of Nerves to the upper Orifice of the Stomach, cauſes theſe loathings and vomitings. And to prove that it is thus,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34775:117"/> and not by the pretended ill humors, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in that many Women begin to vomit from the firſt day of their being with Child, who were in perfect health before they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, which the ſuppreſſion of the Courſes could not cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>loathing,</hi> or <hi>nauſeouſneſs,</hi> is a deſire to vomit, and a motion by which the ſtomach is drawn towards its upper orifice, without caſting up any thing; and vomiting is a more violent motion, by which is caſt forth of the mouth whatſoever is contained in it.</p>
                  <p>At firſt vomiting is but a ſingle ſymptome, not to be feared, but continuing long it weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the Stomach very much; and hindring digeſtion corrupts the food in lieu of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocting it; whence ſucceed ill humors which require purging. Theſe vomitings common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continue till the 3d or 4th month of being with Child; which is the time the Child ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears manifeſtly to be quick; then they begin to ceaſe, and Women recover the appetite they had loſt; becauſe the Infant in growing hath need of more nouriſhment: and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes thoſe humors which flew to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; and beſides the Womb is then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to its extenſion; theſe continue in ſome till they are delivered, which often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34775:117"/> miſcarriages; and the rather, the nearer they are to their full time; and others are tormented more towards the end of their reckoning, then at firſt; becauſe then the Stomach cannot be widened enough eaſily to contain the food, being preſſed by the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Womb: ſuch a vomiting to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whoſe Children lye high ſeldom ceaſes before they are deliver'd.</p>
                  <p>Be not troubled at vomitings, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, if they be gentle, without ſtraining, for they are beneficial, but if they continue lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the 3d or 4th month, they are to be remedied; becauſe for want of nouriſhment the Mother and Child will both grow weak; and the continued ſubverſion of the Stomach cauſing great motion of the belly, will force the Child before its time.</p>
                  <p>Now to hinder this vomiting from afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Woman long, for 'tis very hard to ſtop it quite, let her uſe good dyet, but little at a time, that ſhe may keep it without pain, and not be forced to vomit it; and to ſtrengthen it let her eat it with juice of Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or Lemons, Verjuice or roſe vinegar, or eat after Meals a little Marmelade of Quinces; and ſhe muſt forbear fat meat and ſauces, for they ſoften the Skins of the Stomach,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:34775:118"/> which are weak and looſe by vomitings, and alſo ſweet ſauces.</p>
                  <p>But if for all this that it continues, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Woman be above half gone; 'tis a clear ſign there are cleave corrupt humors to the inward ſides of the Stomach, which muſt be purged by ſtool; to effect which, give half a dram of Rhubard, a dram or two at moſt of Sena, infuſs'd in poſſet-Ale, to which ſtreined add an ounce of Syrup of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cory: which diſſolves the humors, and in voiding them comforts the parts: or you may give her Caſſia and Tamarinds; always add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little Rhubarb, or ſyrup of Succory compound: If once be not enough, repeat it, ſome few days reſpite between; If it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues for all this, you muſt reſt here, leſt ſome worſe thing happen, for ſhe is then in great danger of miſcarrying; and if the Hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coup takes them from too much emptineſs, by vomiting and purging, 'tis very bad, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> Prince and oracle of Phyſick teacheth us.</p>
                  <p>As for great Cupping-glaſſes which ſome advice to be applied to the Stomach to keep it in its place; I believe it's a chip in Potage; becauſe the Stomach is looſe, and no way cleaving to this upper part of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:34775:118"/> the Belly. But ſince theſe vomitings cool and weaken it, I ſhould adviſe them to wear a piece of Scarlet or Flannel, or Lamb-skin, which would help digeſtion.</p>

                  <p>ALL theſe Accidents are but the effects of the widening of the Womb, and the compreſſion it makes on the Neighboring parts by its weight. Theſe are greater the firſt time ſhe is with Child, for afterwards the Womb only receives the ſame dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it had before; and the cords which hold it in its natural place, as well round as large, ſuffer a greater ſtreſs, being much drawn and ſtreightned by the bigneſs and weight of the Womb; to wit the large ones thoſe of the Back and Loins, which anſwer to the Reins, becauſe theſe two ſtrings are ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faſt'ned towards theſe parts; and the round ones cauſe thoſe of the Groins, Share and Thighs where they end. Theſe are ſometimes ſo much ſtretch'd by this weight and higneſs of the Womb that they are torn, chiefly if the Woman chance to have a falſe ſtep, which cauſes very great pains, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worſe accidents; as it happened to a certain Woman, being ſix months gone of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:34775:119"/> her firſt Child, who felt the like after ſhe had ſtumbled, and perceived at the ſame time ſomething crack towards her Reins and Loins, which was one of the large cords, made a noiſe by the ſuddain jolt ſhe receiv'd; at the ſame inſtant ſhe felt extream pains in her Reins and Loins, and all one ſide of her belly, which cauſed her immediately to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, very often with much violence, and the next day was taken with a great continued Feaver, which laſted ſeven or eight days, without being able to ſleep or reſt one hour, all that time ſhe vomited all ſhe took, with a ſtrong and frequent Hiccoup, and great pains, which ſeem'd as if they would haſten her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, which I was very apprehenſive of, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of her death: but by the help of God, cauſing her immediately to be put to Bed, where ſhe reſted 12 whole days, ſhe was thrice let blood in her Arm on ſeveral days, and took a grain of <hi>Laudanum</hi> at twice in the yelk of an Egg, a little to eaſe her violent pains, by giving her reſt; taking alſo from time to time good ſtrengthening Cordials; ſo that all theſe Symptoms, which at firſt ſeemed deſperate, ceaſed by little and little, and ſhe went out her full time, and then was happily delivered of a Son, which lived 15 months, notwithſtanding all thoſe miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours accidents befel her, which were enough
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:34775:120"/> to have kil'd half a dozen others; but God ſometimes is pleaſed to work Miracles by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, aſſiſted with remedies fit for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as well as by his Grace. And alſo the Womb cauſeth the pains of the Hips by its weight, in bearing too much upon them. And aſſure your ſelves there is nothing will eaſe all theſe pains better then to reſt in Bed, and bleed i'th Arm, if there be any great exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or breaking of any cord of the Womb, as was in this caſe; and when the Womb bears too much upon the Hips, if ſhe cannot keep her Bed, ſhe muſt ſupport her Belly with a broad ſwaith.</p>

                  <p>THE ſeat of the Bladder which is juſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Womb, is ſufficient to inſtruct us, why Women with Child, are ſometimes troubled with difficulty of Urine; and why often they cannot hold their water; which is cauſed 2 ways, 1. becauſe the Womb by its bigneſs and weight preſſes the bladder, ſo that 'tis hindred from its ordinary extenſion, and ſo incapable of containing a reaſonable quantity of Urine; which is the cauſe the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhe grows, and the nearer her time, the oftner ſhe's compelled to make water, 2. if the weighty burthen of the Womb doth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much preſs the bottom of the bladder, it forceth the Woman to make water every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but if the neck of it be preſſed it is fil'd full with Urine, being not able to expel it, becauſe the <hi>Sphincter</hi> Muſcle, in this compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, cannot be opened to let it out, which cauſes great pain. Sometimes by its ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſtirs up the bladder often by pricking it, to diſcharge it ſelf; and ſometimes by its
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:34775:122"/> heat it makes an inflammation in the neck of the bladder, which cauſes its ſtopping: and if it be from a ſtone in the bladder 'tis more in ſupportable and dangerous to a Woman with Child then one that is not; becauſe the Womb, by its ſwelling cauſeth the ſtone per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually to preſs againſt the bladder, and the pains are violenter, if it be greater, or of an unequal or ſharp ſhape.</p>
                  <p>'Tis of great moment to hinder theſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent endeavors to make water, and to remedy them, if poſſible, in all indiſpoſitions, becauſe by long continuance of forcing downwards to make water, the Womb is looſened and bears down, and is ſometimes forced to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge its ſelf of its burthen before its time: which we muſt endeavour to hinder, having reſpect to its different cauſes; as when it comes from the weight of the Womb, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the bladder, as for the moſt part; now ſhe may remedy it, if with both her hands when ſhe would make water, ſhe lift up the bottom of her belly; or wear a large ſwath or keep her bed.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſharpneſs of Urine that makes an inflammation i'th neck oth' bladder, appeaſe it by a cooling dyet, forbearing ſtrong drinks, uſing emulſions made of the 4 cold ſeeds, or
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:34775:122"/> whey with ſyrup of Violets; uſe not purging becauſe its heat augments the inflammation; theſe are proper to cleanſe the Urinary paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, without either prejuding Mother or Child, taken Morning and Evening. If all this prevail not let her blood a little i'th Arm; and bath the outward entry of the neck of the bladder with a decoction of Mallows, Marſh-mallows, Pellitory and Violets, with a little Linfeed; and inject ſome of the ſame into the bladder, to which you may add Hony of Violets, or luke warm Milk: abſtaining from all diuretics, for fear they provoke Abortion. And when all fails ſhe muſt ſend for a Phyſitian or Chyrurgeon to make uſe of his <hi>Catheter;</hi> And alſo if it ariſe from the ſtone in the neck of the bladder, they may thruſt it back with it; but if ſmall draw it forth; for a great one cannot be drawn forth before ſhe be delivered; being better to leave her ſo then endanger her life or the Childs.</p>

                  <p>THey whoſe Infants lye low, are more troubled with difficulty of Urine, then they whoſe lye higher, who are free from that and the like diſtemper, but are more ſubject to a Cough and difficult breathing.</p>
                  <p>If a Cough be violent, to vomiting, 'tis one of the chiefeſt things which cauſe Abortion; becauſe 'tis an eſſay whereby the Lungs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to caſt forth of the Breaſt that which offends them by a compreſſion of all its Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which preſſing all the incloſed air in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, wherewith the Lungs are much ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thruſts alſo downwards by the ſame means, the midriff, and conſequently all the parts of the lower belly, but particularly the Womb, which continuing long and violent, often cauſeth Abortion.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it proceeds from ſharp rheums, which diſtil from the brain upon the Artery and Lungs; and ſometimes from ſuch blood, which flows towards the Breaſt; upon ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:34775:123"/> the Terms; alſo from too cold air breathing which ſtirs up the parts to motion; but being begun by theſe cauſes 'tis often aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the compreſſion the Womb makes upon the Midriff, which cannot have its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in thoſe that bear their Children high; becauſe by its great extenſion it bears up al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the parts of the lower belly, towards the Breaſt, and chiefly the Stomach and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, forcing them againſt the Midriff.</p>
                  <p>You muſt remedy this by keeping good dyet ſomewhat cooling, if from ſharp humors, avoiding all Salt and Spice meats, Oranges, Lemons, Vinegar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſhe may uſe juice of Liquorice, Sugar-candy, ſyrup of Violets, or Mulberries, which ſhe may mix with a Ptyſan made with <hi>Jujubs, Sebeſtens,</hi> French Barley, and a little Liquorice; and it may not be amiſs to divert and draw down theſe humors by a gentle Clyſter. If theſe prevail not, and there appears ſigns of fulneſs of blood, bleed her in the Arm, at what time ſoever of going with Child; and though it be not uſually practis'd when they are young with Child, yet here it muſt; for a continual Cough is much more dangerous then a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate bleeding. If it come of cold keep in a cloſe Room with a napkin doubled about her Neck, or a Lamb-Skin; and going to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:34775:124"/> bed take 3 or 4 ſpoonfuls of this ſyrup of burnt wine following, which is very Pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and cauſeth good digeſtion.</p>
                  <p>Take half a pint of <hi>French</hi> wine, 2 drams of Cinnamon bruiſed, half a dozen cloves, 4 ounces of white Sugar or Sugar-candy; put them together in a Porrenger, and boil them upon a Chaffing diſh of Coals, burn it, and then boil it to the conſiſtence of a Syrup.</p>
                  <p>You muſt not from whatever cauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, that ſhe muſt go looſe in her cloaths; and becauſe ſleep is proper to ſtay fluxions, it may be procured by the Phyſitian: uſing no ſtrong ſtupefactives of <hi>opium,</hi> which are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, if there be not very great neceſſity; as in the patient mentioned in the Section of the pain of Back, Loins, Reins and Hips.</p>
                  <p>Some Women carry their firſt Child chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo high, becauſe the cords which ſupport the Womb are not ſtretch'd, that they think them to be in their Breaſts, which cauſes a difficult breathing, as ſoon as they have eaten a little, walked or gone up the ſtairs; ſo that they fear they ſhall be choaked; which comes from the Wombs being enlarged and preſſing the Stomach and the Liver, which forces the Midriff upward, leaving it no room
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:34775:124"/> to be moved: ſometimes their Lungs are ſo full of blood, driven thither from all parts that it hardly leaves paſſage for the air; if ſo they will breath more eaſily as ſoon as a little blood is taken from the Arm; but if it comes from a compreſſion made by the womb againſt the Midriff, the beſt remedy is to wear her clothes looſe, and eat little and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; eating no windy meats as peaſe, and avoiding all grief and fear, becauſe they drive the blood to the Heart and Lungs in too great quantity, ſo that ſhe having her Breaſt already ſtuffed, and hardly breathing, will be in danger of being choak'd; for the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of blood filling the Ventricles of the Heart above meaſure and at once, hinders its motion, without which ſhe cannot live.</p>

                  <p>MAny think, which is in part true, that the Woman having more blood then the Infant needs to nouriſh it, nature by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the expulſive faculty of the upper parts which are always ſtrongeſt, drives the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity upon the lower, as the Legs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as moſt feeble and apt to receive it; and ſo are cauſed their ſwelling and pain and ſometimes red ſpots, from the ſwelling of the Veins, along the inſide, which extreamly hinders her going: but the doctrine of the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blood, invented by our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the immortal Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> the Engliſh <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> will teach us better how this comes, then that we need have have recourſe to this expulſive faculty; but becauſe 'tis fitter for Phyſitians and Chyrurgeons that are learned in Anatomy then Midwifes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they may help them without ſuch curious knowledge; I ſhall omit it, and if you would

                  </p>
                  <p>Now to remedy theſe let her only uſe a palliative cure, in ſwathing the parts with a rowler 3 or 4 fingers broad; beginning at the bottom, and ſhe ſhould moſt keep her bed, if ſhe can; and if there be ſigns of abundance of blood in other parts ſhe may bleed without danger.</p>
                  <p>Some Womens Legs ſwell only from weakneſs, and are ſo Flegmatick that when you preſs them with your finger the print remains; becauſe they want Natural heat ſufficient to concoct all the nouriſhment ſent to them, and expel its ſuperfluities, which remaining makes them ſo Hydropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. To reſolve theſe ſwellings, make a Lee made with the aſhes of Vines, or other wood aſhes, and Melilote, Camomil, and Lavender boild in it; if that do not foment them with this. Take Roſemary, Bays, Time, Merjoram, Sage and Lavender, of each a handful, Province Roſes half a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Pomgranat flowers and Alum, each an ounce, boil them in 3 pints of ſtrong

                  <p>Of the Belly are three kinds, the firſt <hi>Lien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria,</hi> when the Stomach and Guts not digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nouriſhments received let it paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way raw. 2. <hi>Diarrhea,</hi> when they ſimply diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the humours and excrements which they contain. The 3d and worſt is a <hi>Dyſente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> when with the humors and excrements ſhe voids blood, with violent pains, caus'd by an ulceration of the Guts.</p>
                  <p>Any of theſe if they continue long put her in great danger of Aborting; if the firſt, the Stomach letting the food paſs before it be turned into juice, whereof blood is made to nouriſh Mother and Child, they muſt both be weakened; if the 2d it will cauſe the ſame accident; becauſe of voiding the Spirits with the humors; but moſt danger's i'th laſt,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:34775:128"/> becauſe ſhe hath then great pains and Gripes i'th Guts from their Ulcer; which excites them continually, by conſtant prickings, to diſcharge themſelves of the ſharp humors which cauſes a violent motion of the Womb, being pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This Flux happens to her commonly from a weak digeſtion of the Stomach, becauſe of her bad dyet, which her ſtrange appetite cauſes her often to long for, by the conſtant uſe whereof at laſt being weakened it ſuffers the food to paſs without digeſtion, or if it ſtay longer 'tis turn'd into a corrupt juice,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:34775:129"/> which deſcending into the Guts iritates them by its ſharpneſs to diſcharge themſelves as ſoon as they can.</p>
                  <p>To proceed ſafely in the cure of theſe Fluxes, their nature muſt be conſider'd, that the cauſe that maintains them may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd. If it be a <hi>Lienteria</hi> following Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings, as is uſual, which have ſo weakn'd the Stomach, and looſn'd its Skins, that have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no longer ſtrength to vomit up the food, it ſuffers it to paſs downward without dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; then ſhe muſt refrain all irregular appetites, and eat food of good digeſtion and little at a time, ſhe may drink a little deep Claret wine, in which Iron hath been quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if ſhe have not a ſtrong Feaver, for in a ſmall one wine is to be prefer'd, becauſe her Feaver is but ſymptomatick, from the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her Stomach, and will vaniſh as ſoon as it is fortified; which may be promoted if ſhe take before and after meals, ſome of that burnt wine ſpoke of before for the Cough, or a little good Hippocras, or right Canary, or eat a little Marmalade of quinces before meals; and wear a Lamb-skin upon the pit of her Stomach; be ſure to give no purge, for this is only cauſed by weakneſs.</p>

                  <p>But if for all fit purges, it changes into a Dyſentery, ſhe is then in danger of miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying; which muſt be prevented if poſſible; therefore having purged the ill humor, and hindering, that no more be engendred, by Chicken or Veal broths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with cooling herbs, pap with the yelk of an Egg well boild, let her quench Iron or Steel in her drink which muſt be ſmall beer or water, with a little ſtrong, or wine, if ſhe be not Feaveriſh, for then half a ſpoonful of ſyrup of Quinces, or Pomgranates is better; and ſhe may eat a little Marmalade of Quince, or other ſtrengtheners, if ſhe was purg'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and becauſe there is always great gripes, they muſt be appeas'd, by Clyſters made of the broth of a Calves or Sheeps head well boild, with 2 ounces of oil of Violets;

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:34775:131"/> at whatever time, it proceeds likewiſe from the opening of the Veſſels of the Womb's fund, cauſed by ſome blow, ſlip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and chiefly becauſe the ſecundine, ſeparating in part if not wholly from the inſide of the Wombs bottom, to which it ought to ſtick, to receive the Mothers blood, for the Childs nouriture, leaves open all the Orifices of the Veſſels where it joyned, and ſo follows a great flux of blood, which never ceaſes till ſhe be brought a Bed; yet I do not intend it ſhould be done as ſoon as perceiv'd, for ſome ſmall fluddings have been ſtop'd by lying quietly in Bed, bleeding i'th Arm and the uſe of Remedies mention'd in the menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Flux; and it may be but an ordinary monthly Flux; and then 'tis good leaving the Labor to nature, provided ſhe hath ſtrength, and accompanied with no other ill accident; but when ſhe falls into Convulſions and Faintings, 'tis abſolutely neceſſary ſhe be deliver'd, whether ſhe be at her count or no, pains or throws or no, for there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to ſave both their Lives.</p>
                  <p>You muſt not always expect pains and throws to force and forward Labor, in theſe dangerous accidents, for though they come at the beginning, they uſually ceaſe as ſoon as it comes to Faintings and Convulſions;
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:34775:131"/> neither muſt it be put off till the Womb be opened enough, for this Flux moiſtens, and the weakneſs looſens it, ſo that it may then be as eaſily widen'd as if there had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of ſtrong throws. Wherefore let the Midwife introduce her Fingers anointed with Oil or Butter, 2 or 3 at a time, and all by degrees, and at laſt her whole Hand, and if ſhe find the waters not broke, break them, and then whatever part of the Child pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, though the head (provided it be not i'th Birth) let her ſearch for the Feet, and draw it forth by them; obſerving the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in delivery of a Child with the Feet firſt, becauſe there's better hold; ſo that if the Feet lye not ready ſeek for them, which is eaſier done at that time then another; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Fluddings make the Womb ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery: then fetch the after-burthen, which in theſe caſes cleaves but little, being care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to leave ſo much as a clod i'th Womb, leſt it continue the Fludding.</p>
                  <p>In this caſe many Women and Children have periſhed for want of this operation, and many eſcaped death by being timely ſuccor'd. <hi>Guilemeau</hi> a Famous <hi>French</hi> Chirurgion men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions 6 or 7 Hiſtories to confirm this; and <hi>Moriceau</hi> by his experience avers it, and in

Then the beſt thing under the Sun to give her is a good broth, and ſo leave her to ſleep; waking apply this pultis over the bottom of her Belly and Privities, take 2 ounces of Oil of Sweet Almonds, 2 or 3 new laid Eggs, ſtir them together in a pipkin over hot Embers, when 'tis thick apply it indifferently warm, taking away the cloſures and clods of blood; renew this if need be after 5 or 6 hours, then make a decoction of Barley, Linſeed and Chervil, or Marſh-Mallows and Violet leaves, adding an ounce of honey of Roſes to a pint; and foment the bearing place Lukewarm 3 or 4 times a day, for the firſt 5 or 6 days: ſome uſe only milk; and others Barley wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

The 2d day uſe looſe ſwaths with a large ſquare bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, over the Belly, till the 8th day, taking it off; i'th mean time, often to anoint her Belly, if it be ſore, with Oil of ſweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, and <hi>St. John's</hi> wort mixt; then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſwaith her ſtreighter.</p>

This is a more dangerous accident then any can happen to one newly lay'd, which diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches her ſo ſoon, if in great quantity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there's often ſcarce time to remedy it, ſo that you are immediately to apply remedies, both to ſtop, and turn back from
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:34775:138"/> the places whence it flows; to which end if it be a falſe Conception, piece of the burthen, or clotted blood, uſe all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to fetch them away, or cauſe them to be ſpeedily expell'd; but if it flows and nothing remain, bleed her i'th Arm, not ſo much to empty the fulneſs, as to turn the courſe; lay her body equally flat, not raiſed, and keep quiet without turning from ſide to ſide: nor muſt the upper part of her Belly be ſwath'd or bolſtered; keep her Chamber a little cool, and not too warm in Bed: All forbid Clyſters leſt they ſay, humors be cal'd down; but the contrary hath been expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally found, that great fluddings have been ſtopt by pretty ſtrong clenſing ones.</p>

                  <p>ANd here I ſhall make 2 ſorts of Bearing down, and 2 ſorts of falling forth; which differ but in degree, for the firſt is when the Womb only bears down and comes not forth, the 2d when it comes out of the Body.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ſort of bearing down, is when the full body of the Womb falls into the Neck, in ſuch manner as putting up a Finger you may feel the Orifice very near; the 2d when the Womb being yet lower, one can clearly perceive this Orifice quite with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
                  <p>The falling out is twofold too; in one the Womb comes quite forth, but is not turn'd inſide out, nor can its inſide be ſeen, only its orifice; which appears at the end of a great fleſhy Maſs, which makes the body of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:34775:140"/> the Womb; and this is cal'd a falling forth of the Womb; the other is cal'd a <hi>perverſion</hi> or turning inſide out, moſt dangerous; for you may perceive all even and without any Orifice; and thus it ſeems to be only a great piece of bloody fleſh, almoſt like a Mans Cod, which hangs between her Thighs; and that which is wonderful, in this caſe, is, the Womb, the infants houſe, goes forth at the Gate, which is the inner Orifice.</p>
                  <p>A looſening or breaking of the Cords cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the bearing down, which comes from hard Labor: who have many whites are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to it, and heavy Children, Coughing, Sneezings, a fall, going in a Coach or Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, great lifts, burdens, lifting the Arms too high, and putting them over their head; looſeneſs, great pains and needings, all which ſhake and thruſt the Womb downwards, when with Child, and the cords being looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or broken cannot keep it up, ſo that a bearing down doth eaſily follow the Birth of a Child; but the moſt ordinary cauſe is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent travel when a Child cometh wrong, and cannot be born ſo, or hath too big an head, or the inner Orifice not enough opened, for the Womb is violently forced down, and yet the Child can't advance into the paſſage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the cords are ſo rent or looſen'd; or
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:34775:140"/> when the Secondine ſticking cloſe to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom is pul'd away on a ſudden, or too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, and much ſooner if putting up the hand, as when the String's broke, one pulls the body of the Womb inſtead of the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth; but your directions will prevent this.</p>
                  <p>She feels a great weight at the bottom of her Belly, extream pain i'th Reins and Loins; and a bloodiſh moiſture paſſes through this Maſs of Fleſh hanging between her Legs. A looſening may happen to all Women, a fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out but ſeldom, a perfect <hi>perverſion</hi> never but upon or immediately after a delivery; becauſe the inner Orifice is then almoſt as wide as its bottom; but not at other times; when cloſed there is no poſſibility of its turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſide out; how to remedy it, I have told you.</p>
                  <p>If ſhe be young and diſeaſe new, eaſily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a cure, for a looſening or falling out, but if ſhe old, and of a long ſtanding, 'tis ſo much the more incurable.</p>
                  <p>Here do two things. 1. reduce the Womb to its place. 2. ſtrengthen it and keep it there; for the firſt, if it be quite out or turned, firſt make her render Urine, and give
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:34775:141"/> a Clyſter, if neceſſary to empty the Guts; then lay her on her back, her Hips raiſed a little higher than her Head, foment all with a little wine and water luke-warm, and with a ſoft rag put it up, wagging it little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle from ſide to ſide; and if this be too pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful anoint it with Oil of ſweet Almonds, wiping off the Oil as much as may be after.</p>
                  <p>As to the keeping it in its place, and ſtrengthening it after; let her keep in Bed on her back, her Hips a little raiſed, Legs ſomething croſſed, Thighs joined; but the beſt is to put a peſſary up the neck of the Womb; the Figures of which you may ſee; ſome of the Figure of an Egg, of the length and bigneſs of the Womb's neck; but theſe are Subject to fall out, and ſo are not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient as thoſe made of a piece of Cork; they are to be of a thick circular figure, like a ſmall wreath, and peirc'd i'th middle with a pretty big hole; they muſt be cover'd with white wax, and pretty large, pull them out with a Finger to clear them; they may be made ſome round, others ſomewhat ſquare, or trianguler, the corners muſt be blunted or rounded.</p>

                  <p>The readieſt and ſureſt remedy, from what cauſe ſoever, is ſpeedily to draw the Breaſts, till they be empty'd, and if the Child cannot, becauſe ſhe is hard milched, let a Woman, till it comes freely, and then the Child will; and that ſhe may not after breed more Milk then the Child can draw, let her dyet breed but little nouriſhment, and keep her body always open.

                  <p>WOmen are ſubject the firſt time to have their Niples chop'd, which is unſufferable, and the more if hard milch'd, as the firſt time, when the Milk hath not yet made way through the ſmall holes of the Niples, which are not yet thorowly open'd, and then the Child takes more pains to ſuck; and ſometimes theſe chops do ſo encreaſe by the Childs ſucking, that the Niple's taken quite off the Breaſt, and there reſts an Ulcer very hard to be cur'd. This may happen from the Childs being ſo dry and hungry that it hath not patience to ſuck ſoftly, but finding the Milk not ſpeedily to follow as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, bite and pinch the Niple ſo hard that it becomes raw, and at laſt take it quite away. This happens alſo when Infants have hot mouths, or thruſhes, or the pox ſooneſt.</p>
                  <p>Theſe muſt not be neglected, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the great pain, as to avoid their growing worſe and worſe. Therefore as
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:34775:149"/> ſoon as they begin forbear giving ſuck, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back her milk for a ſmall time; and if but one Niple be ſore, ſhe may ſuckle with the other; Applying Allum or Lime-water, or only bath them with Plantain water, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoft rags dipt in any of them or a ceruſe plaiſter, or <hi>Diapompholigos,</hi> or a little ſtarch powdred; but chiefly take care that nothing be apply'd to diſtate the Child; wherefore many uſe only Honey of Roſes. Softening remedies are fit to preſerve from chops, but when they are already made, dryers are beſt, and to prevent her from hurts in theſe parts, and that the rags may not ſtick to them, put upon them a little Wax, or wooden caps, or leaden ones, they being more drying, like theſe in the Figure; having ſeveral ſmall holes on their tops, as well to give iſſue to the matter, as that the Milk may paſs away.</p>
                  <p>If the Nipples are wholly ſuck'd off, then dry the Milk up; and if the Child have the pox, put it to another who muſt uſe preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatives againſt it: but if they be only ſmall, ſimple Ulcers i'th Mouth without any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, waſh them only with Barley water with a little juice of Citrons or Lemons; and let the Nurſe uſe a cooling dyet, and bleed and purge if neceſſary.</p>

                  <p>The Child can take no hold when the Nipples are quite gone, and the ſmall holes are cloſed up; but if ſhe ſhall deſire to give ſuck, let Woman by degrees make her new Nipples (after the Ulcer's perfectly heal'd) and unſtop the root of the old ones: or uſing an Inſtrument of Glaſs, as in the Figure, ſhe may ſuck them her ſelf 5 or 6 times a day; and to preſerve them, and ſhape them, thus drawn out, from ſinking into the Breaſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, let her put a ſmall cap upon them as before, and ſo by degrees ſhe may give ſuck again.</p>

                  <p>Now Sir ſome are for the Mothers ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her own Child, and will bring you Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for it too; for ſay they did not <hi>Sarah</hi> Nurſe <hi>Iſaac?</hi> therefore every Woman ought to Nurſe her own Child; but this is but a weak Argument; for, from Scripture, to retort their Argument on them, <hi>David</hi> was a King and a Prophet, therefore every man muſt be a King, and every King a Prophet: others again give you profound reaſons; as they imagine; as that the Mothers milk is moſt convenient for the Child, becauſe it partakes of her nature; But I would ask theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whether every Cholerick Woman hath Cholerick Children; or every Phlegmatick Woman Phlegmatick Children? and ſo of the reſt: Another reaſon is, becauſe the Woman they ſay cannot love her Child, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſhe give it ſuck her own ſelf. But if ſhe do not for all that, in my opinion ſhe is very inhumane and unnatural.</p>
                  <p>Others again are of a quite contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and thwart all this; for firſt ſay theſe, the Child draws its conditions from its Nurſe, to prove which they quote ſeveral examples; as <hi>Alcibiades</hi> being an <hi>Athenian,</hi> was ſo ſtrong and valiant becauſe he ſuck'd a <hi>Spartan</hi> Woman: but <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> ſays the <hi>Germans</hi> were ſuch ſtrong bon'd men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:34775:151"/> they ſuck'd their own Mothers; then why had not <hi>Alciliades</hi> been ſo if he had ſuck'd his? But all Authors generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing of what complexion and condition a Nurſe ought to be, if every Woman then muſt Nurſe her own Child, any complexion muſt then of neceſſity ſerve the turn.</p>
                  <p>Since the choice of a Nurſe is of ſo great a concernment; (as upon which, the future being of the infant conſiſts) ſurely this, then requires many ſerious conſiderations, For, though ſhe may have milk enough; yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not good enough; or the woman ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſluttiſh, or unhandy, or careleſs in the ſwathing and the dreſſing of the Child; by which many children (like new veſſels, which will keep the ſavour of that liquor they are firſt ſeaſoned withal) are ſluttiſh or ſlovenly ſo long as they live; or elſe (being abuſed at Nurſe, are Crooked and Ricketty; full of botches, naſty and nauſeous to their own Parents. And many, through their intemperancy, by drinking, to encreaſe their milk, and perhaps make it bad enough, ſleep ſo ſecurely and profoundly, that they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay their Nurſeries in the night, and the Children are dead by their ſides in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Therefore let nurſes ſleep ſo often, that they may hear the leaſt cry of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant.
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:34775:152"/> Let the Nurſe then, be of middle ſtature, and good complexion; active, not fat, (and of a ſanguine complexion, if poſſible) and not in poverty; not under twenty years of Age, not above forty, but rather of twenty five, or thirty. Let not her nipples be great, leaſt it make the child of a wide mouth, becauſe it cannot ſuck without the contraction of the lips together and leſt by forcing the Tongue into too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a compaſs, it hinders the ſwallowing of the milk.</p>
                  <p>Next, if the nipple be too ſmall, the child is apt to let it ſlip out of the mouth, and cannot handſomely hold it, ſo that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant being fruſtrated of ſuck, and yet ſtill exerciſing ſuckling, hurts the cheek, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts ſome kind of humors thither, which oftentimes become unnatural Tumors; and oftentimes the cheeks of the infant ſeem as if they were moved out of their places. Thirdly, by the conſent of all, the Nurſe muſt have a large breaſt (though ſome think that not ſo material, becauſe there is more milk collected together in great breaſts than ought; and being there, is corrupted, to the prejudice of the Nurſe. Wherefore, leſt the milk ſhould continue there too long, it is beſt to have a young luſty child to ſuck it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; or elſe to uſe it ſome other way; as
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:34775:152"/> by the uſe of young whelps; whom I have ſeen dye with ſucking Womens milk; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the reaſon muſt be, becauſe the milk was of another nature; or elſe, becauſe curdled and corrupted or milked out ſome other way; eſpecially, when the Nurſe perceives her ſelf prejudiced by it. But it is ever beſt, that ſhe abound, rather than want Milk; and then in this caſe it is beſt they be big, though all Nurſes need not have big breaſts; for there may be as much Milk, if not more, in a leſſer breaſt, than in a great one.</p>
                  <p>The next enquiry will be into the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and behaviour of a Nurſe.</p>
                  <p>The beſt Nurſe then is, ſhe that is mild, chaſte, ſober, courteous, chearful, lively, neat, cleanly, and handy; becauſe bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as well as good, are ſuck'd in with the milk, and ſo radicated, that it is a hard matter to pull out the bad conditions, and leave the good behind, but that there will be a remainder of the bad conditions, perhaps ſo long as they live: wherefore, let not the Nurſe be of an angry, malepert, and ſaucy diſpoſition, ſhameleſs, ſcolding, or quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; not gluttonous, but ſo careful of her Nurſery, that ſhe neither eat or drink that which may be hurtful to the Infant: That
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:34775:153"/> ſhe do nothing to anger her ſelf, to grieve, or ſad her ſelf; for ſuch paſſions will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſtribute themſelves, to the prejudice of the Infant; than which there is nothing of more efficacy to deſtroy the goodneſs of the Milk.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it ſufficient that they abſtain from the uſe of their husbands; but when they have wanton thoughts, and laſcivious minds, wholly upon Luxury and Venery, they caſt off all care of the Nurſeries, and dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at night of that which their minds run on in the day, and by other filthy pollutions they infect the milk. So alſo, by the uſe of their Husbands the Courſes are ſtirred up, by which both the plenty and goodneſs of milk is derived another way; and ſo the Child robbed of its nutriment; or elſe the Nurſe conceiveth with Child, and ſo the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant becometh diſeaſed and Ricketty, by ſucking curdy and unwholſome milk, and is worſe for it during life.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let all thoſe things be avoided, that either do, or are ſuppoſed to provoke luſt; as, junkets made with ſpices; alſo Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Leeks, Garlick, and all ſalt meats are to be avoided: Perſly and Smallage, ſome ſay, have a peculiar malice to the increaſe of
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:34775:153"/> milk: beſides that, it doth increaſe luſt, and is an enemy to the growth of Infants.</p>
                  <p>Again, that Nurſe were beſt, that hath lately been brought to bed of a Boy if to Nurſe a Boy, the milk of ſuch a Nurſe being better tempered. For the milk of a Male Child will make a Female Nurſery more ſpritely, and a man like Virago; and the milk of a girl will make a boy the more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate.</p>
                  <p>As to the milk, let it be a mean, betwixt thick and thin; which you may perceive, by dropping it upon the Thumb-Nails; for if it be too thin, it will run off the ſooner; but if thicker, it will ſtay the longer: let it be ſweet, and pleaſant, both to the ſmell and taſte; not offending the palate with rancid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſourneſs, ſharpneſs, or ſaltneſs; or the noſtrils with any ſtrange quality. Let it be candid to the ſight, in it ſelf equal in each particles, not infeſted with brown, yellow, green, blue, or any other evil colour; or, as ſometimes, with various colours and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; as, with lines, and ſtreaks upon it: but let that milk be moſt praiſe-worthy, that makes as much curd as whey; which may be tryed by this Experiment, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>The thinneſs of Milk is amended by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary food, ſuch as doth incraſſate it: as Fromenty of Wheat, and Rice; Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feet, Calves-feet, Trotters, and ſweet Wine unleſs ſomewhat elſe be in the way to hinder it. Sometimes it happens that the Milk is more tart than it ought to be: wherefore then, all diligence muſt be had to feed upon ſuch meats as are of the beſt juice, till that acrimony at leaſt be attempered.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes there is little or no milk in the breaſts; as after ſome ſickneſs, or notable diſtemper, now turned into a bad habit, or any other of what kind ſoever, that poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thoſe parts, or is the cauſe: but that
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:34775:154"/> ſhall not be our buſineſs to conſider of now.</p>
                  <p>Now, if theſe be not the cauſes, let the Nurſe uſe ſupping meats, as Broths, Poſſets, &amp;c. and eat plentifully, and uſe rubbings to her Breaſts and Duggs, exerciſing her hands and her Arms by domeſtick Employments; or inſtead thereof, let her dance the Child, by which the aliment may be recalled into thoſe parts.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes cupping-glaſſes to the Breaſts, with a fomentation of emollient herbs boiled in water, and applied warm, either with ſponges, or wollen-clothes; after which, chafe them with oyl of Lillies. The ſeeds of Fennel, and the roots of Parſnips boiled in Barley-water, and buttered. The broth of Hens, or Capons, with Cinnamon and Mace.</p>
                  <p>Or Poch'd-eggs, with the ſeeds of <hi>Annis,</hi> and <hi>Dill;</hi> and all things elſe that are hot in the firſt and ſecond degree, are good.

                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:34775:155"/>
                  <p>All theſe may be of good uſe in the defect of Milk. As to the inconveniency (if there be any) in too much Milk. If the Milk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound too much, which ſometimes is (though ſeldome) blamable; Then uſe the decoction of Myrtleberries, and red Roſes, and with clothes dipped in it, lay them on the Breaſts. Or elſe clothes imbibed in Vinegar, wherein Cummin-ſeeds bruiſed have been infuſed with Myrrh and Camphire.</p>
                  <p>By reaſon of the thickneſs of the Milk, all thoſe excrements that the Child ſhould ſend forth, are intercepted; as by Stool, by U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The paſſages for tranſpiration are ſtuffed up, ſo that the progreſs of the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being ſtop'd, of neceſſity the Milk muſt be vomited up; after which will follow much flegmatick matter, a ſure argument of crudities.</p>

                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:34775:155"/>
                  <p>Alſo, very angry puſtules and whelks will ariſe about the body, like the ſmall Pox; and the body groweth weak by little and little, the Infant not caring for food; for the ſtrength of the appetite will be more remiſs, by reaſon of the ſharpneſs of that which the Infant deſires; ſo that it is not much ſenſible of that aliment which it hath; and that ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which it is ſenſible is naught, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
                  <p>Now, as from the over-bundance of Milk, the Infant oftentimes, when it ſucks, is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, being ſo puffed up, and the belly diſtended, as if it would break; until by much piſſing, or breaking wind, it is ſlacker. So where there is too much ſcarcity of milk, there the Infant being altogether deſtitute of its nouriſhment, will pine away; and all the parts of the body being ſtarved, in thoſe years when it moſt wants nouriſhment, by reaſon of vehemency of the innate heat, and that habit of body (that the leaſt blaſt will puff down) which requires much, and conſtant aliment.</p>
                  <p>By all which, Women ought to be the more provident, leſt all theſe miſchiefs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, (eſpecially, not to make choice of ſuch a Nurſe, whoſe poverty muſt needs ſtarve
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:34775:156"/> her ſelf, and her Nurſery; and if they ſhould ſo happen, to amend them, as hath been ſaid before) e're they grow incurable, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the help of another Artiſt that may cure it.</p>
                  <p>Or, if the fault in the milk cannot be cured and amended in the Nurſe, (which ſhe hath contracted,) Then you have no more to do, but preſently to look for another Nurſe, that hath none of theſe inconveniencies; that ſo the Infant may have ſuck enough, which is all it requires; for want of which, you may hear ſad crying, and weeping. And this may be diſcovered by their dreams, as by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten motion of the lips in the cradle, as if they were ſucking when they are a ſleep.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it ſtrange, that the Infant ſhould be ſenſible of, and Participate of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever food (as meat, drink, and Phyſick,) that the Nurſe taketh: which maketh Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians purge the Nurſe, to cure the Child: if a woman take any purging Phyſick, ſhe purgeth her Child alſo. So, <hi>Galen</hi> reports that of Goats, feeding in <hi>Aſia,</hi> where Scam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony grow, did communicate a purging fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to their milk. And ſo the milk of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, generally accounted beſt in Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is counted better, if the Aſſe be fed with
<pb facs="tcp:34775:156"/> ſuch herbs, as Maiden-hair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And again, when young Goats ſuck Sheeps-milk, the rough hair ſhall loſe its courſneſs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like a fleece of wooll: and ſo contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when Lambs are brought up by Goats, their wooll groweth the more hairy.</p>
                  <p>If then the qualities of the milk paſs into thoſe that ſuck them, (as without doubt they do) it is eaſie to gather, that other impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties follow thither alſo, neither is it impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. Surely then, we ought to take no leſs care of the Nurſe than of the Child; as in her diet, exerciſe, phyſick, &amp;c. ſince, whatſoever conduceth to the benefit of the Nurſe, tends to the good and welfare of the Infant.</p>
                  <p>I have been the larger upon this Sir of Nurſes, and Milk, becauſe tender Infants can neither make choice of their Nurſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; nor diſcover, or plead for their wants: Their own Mothers, ſurely, (if they are able) both by duty, and nature, being the moſt fit to Nurſe their own Children; which the greateſt Ladies may do, with the greateſt conveniences; by reaſon of their plenty of all things; beſides, their attendance of ſervants, who can bring their Nurſeries to them at all hours, be it by night or day,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:34775:157"/> and take it from them again, not to diſturb their reſt: which alſo, they may tend at their own pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>The longeſt time that a Child need be ſuckled, is till it have teeth to chew with. I ſhall leave only one caution for Nurſes, and and ſo wind up: and 'tis this: Let Nurſes ever milk out ſome Milk e're they ſuckle the Child; and after it is ſuckled, that they rock it not too much preſently after, leſt violent rocking diſturb the meat in the ſtomach; or the other parts draw away the Milk in the ſtomach, as yet unconcocted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Dr.</label> Thus far have you done very well good Mrs. <hi>Eutrapelia,</hi> as in all other things ſo as to what concerns the Choice and office of Nurſes; and now if you pleaſe you ſhall hear a few of my obſervations about the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which it may be, may not be unwelcome to you.</p>
                  <p>Then you muſt know that I have taken notice of 2 ſorts of Nurſes, which I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in the World; The one ſort is ſuch as are of an ill humor or blood; the which ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in their Milk, being the place at that time where they diſcharge themſelves.</p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:34775:157"/>
                  <p>Now you muſt note that theſe ſort of Women are in a better condition when they are Nurſes then when they are not; for when they are not Nurſes, they are ſubject to pains in their Arms ſometimes, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in their Shoulders, and ſometimes in their Legs or Thighs; or elce they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to wateriſh Eyes, or ſwelling in their Eyes or Noſe.</p>
                  <p>Now the Infants which ſuck theſe Nurſes, if they be fat, 'tis not good but ſoft fat, and they are dull and ſottiſh; and coming to breed Teeth they are very ſickly and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly dye, by reaſon of the reum puſhing out of too many Teeth at once; and if they eſcape this they are more troubled with bad juices in their Infancy, then their Parents in their old age; and if the reum be ſalt the Milk is of a blackiſh and blewiſh colour; but if it be of Choler, 'tis yet the more dangerous and venemous to the Children.</p>
                  <p>There is another ſort of Nurſes, and they are ſuch as who after they have layen in, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſome 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 months, are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with their purgations; a thing which never happens to good Nurſes; and when this does happen they are more dangerous then the former, and the Child muſt preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:34775:158"/> be taken away, for they are more apt to conceive then to Nurſe; and if they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Nurſes they do but ruine the Children; for there dyes a third part of the Children, for want of taking care in this particular, which yet ſeem fat and in good caſe; for this is the cauſe of great colic, and windineſs in Infants which kils them in a moment; for the leaſt Feaver that takes them carries them away.</p>
                  <p>And now to come home to the purpoſe, let me tell you the firſt and principal of all the qualities in a good Nurſe, is that ſhe be the Childs own Mother, as well becauſe of the mutual ſympathy of their tempers, as that having much more love for it, ſhe will be much more careful then an hired Nurſe, who commonly loves her Nurſe Child but with a feined love; ſo that the Mother, though ſhe be not the beſt Nurſe, ſhould always be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd before another.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe there are divers that either will not, or cannot ſuckle their own Children, there is then an Obligation to provide ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nurſe; which ſhould be choſen for the Child's good, as near as may be. For even as we ſee trees, of the ſame kind, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſame, yet being afterwards trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:34775:158"/> to another Soil, do produce fruits of a different taſte, by reaſon of the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they draw from thence; even ſo it fares with the health of Children; and their manners ſometimes depend on the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they receive at the beginning; for as the health of the body anſwers to the humors that all the parts are nouriſhed with, which humors always retain the nature of the food whereof they are engendred; and as for the manners they commonly follow the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, which likewiſe proceeds from the nature of the humors, and the humors from the food; from whence may be drawn this conſequence, that as the Nurſe is, ſo will the Child be both in body and mind by means of the nouriſhment it draws from her.</p>
                  <p>This may plainly appear in Animals that ſuck a ſtrange dam; for they always purchaſe ſomething of the nature of the Creature they ſuck; being accordingly either of a mild or fierce nature, of a ſtrong or weak body; as may be ſeen in young Lions which will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come tame by ſucking a domeſtic Animal, as a Cow, Aſs, or Goat, and on the other ſide a Dog will become more furious if it ſucks a Wolf.</p>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:34775:159"/>
                  <p>Now the neceſſary conditions requiſite in a good Nurſe, are uſually taken from her Age, the time and manner of her Labor, the Conſtitution of all the parts of her Body, and particularly of her Breaſts, the nature of her Milk, and laſtly from her manners.</p>
                  <p>As concerning her Age, the moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient is from 25 to 35 years of Age; Then as to the time and manner of her Labor, it muſt be at leaſt a month or 6 weeks after that, and not above 5 or 6 months; ſhe muſt not have miſcarried, and ſhe muſt have layn in of a 2d or third Child, that ſhe may know the better how to perform her Office.</p>
                  <p>As to the healthful conſtitution of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, 'tis the principal thing, on which almoſt all the reſt depend, for ſhe ought to come of Parents that never had the ſtone in the Reins or Bladder, or Gout, Kings-Evil, Falling-ſickneſs, or any other hereditary diſtemper; that ſhe have no Scab, or Itch, and that ſhe be ſtrong, neither too tall, nor too low; not too fat, nor too lean, and above all ſhe muſt not be with Child; let her be of a Sanguine Complexion, which is known by her Vermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion color, not altogether ſo red, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to white; of a firm, faſt fleſh; not ſubject to the Whites, for that's a ſign of a
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:34775:159"/> bad habit; not red hair'd, nor mark'd with red ſpots; but black hair'd, or of a Cheſnut brown; neat in her Cloaths, of a ſprightly Eye, and a ſmiling countenance, ſound and white Teeth, for if they be rotten her breath may ſmell; having a good voice to pleaſe and rejoice the Child, and a clear and free pronuntiation that the Child learn, not an ill accent from her, as uſually red hair'd have, and ſometimes thoſe that are very black hair'd with white Skins; for their Milk is hot, ſharp and ſtinking, and alſo of an ill Taſt.</p>
                  <p>Her Breaſts ought to be pretty big to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and concoct a ſufficient quantity of milk; being ſound and free from ſcars, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from former Impoſtumes; being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different firm and fleſhy, that their natural heat may be the ſtronger; ſhe muſt be broad breaſted that her Milk may have the more room to be prepared and digeſted in, and becauſe 'tis a ſign of a great deal of vital heat.</p>
                  <p>As to her Nipples they muſt be well ſhap'd as you obſerv'd, not too big, nor too hard, nor griſtly, nor ſunk in too deep; but they muſt be a little raiſed, and of a moderate big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and firmneſs, with many little holes, that
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:34775:160"/> ſhe may be ſoft milch'd, to the end the Child may not take too much pains to draw the milk by ſucking them and preſſing them with its Mouth.</p>
                  <p>All theſe good qualities being found in a Nurſe, reſpecting all the parts of her.
